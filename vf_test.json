The service here was bad. Our servers didn't bother to pay attention to us, and without asking, she gave us the bill before our dessert even arrived!\n\n-Pork Buns - hoisin, scallion, cucumber - $10: I love the pork buns in Momofuku, but it's not something that I would come back for just to have. For $10, these didn't have enough cucumber or scallion. I wish it would have had something pickled to add some tart to the buns and balance the flavour out. In any case, these were delicious and the pork just melt in your mouth, mhmm so good. \n\n-Winter Ramen - smoked chicken, squash, kale, egg - $15: although this time they improved a bit with the broth, it was still lukewarm, not hot like other authentic Japanese ramen joints. The broth lacked flavor and I didn't taste the kale at all. That small yellow lump in the center is the squash and when mixed with the broth, the entire dish turned too sweet so I don't understand why they felt the need to add squash onto the dish? Also, I'm surprised the egg was poached, hence it had a very runny egg yolk, which is completely different from a traditional Japanese ramen... Normally the egg should be soft-boiled, with the egg white just set and an almost runny egg yolk. The best part of the dish is perhaps the chicken. It was cooked perfectly and the sauce seemed to be a teriyaki sauce? Very delicious and flavorful.\n\n-Milk bar soft serve- Twist of Cereal Milk and Fried Apple Pie - $8:  I prefer the cereal milk instead of the fried apple pie. The fried apple pie was overly sweet whereas the cereal milk was done just right. I remember there was a slight salty taste to the cereal milk soft serve, it was really unique and overall, delicious!", "business_id": "zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-04-03", "useful": 2, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "xYciRtVZ1PW4IxSX4oJ1aw", "review_id": "oKj4IRaTIIdc3gwjDXCD7w", "text": "Take note that most of these dishes are tapa styles, meaning the portions are smaller. I really, really wanted to like this place as Eric was my favourite on Master Chef Canada, but my expectation felt short. The menu is definitely unique, but it was too overhyped and the majority of dishes didn't deliver. Also, the pricing is higher compared to other restaurants in the area, so I expected the quality of food to be reflect the premium paid. The service and ambience was nice, but I would suggest R&D as a restaurant for late-night snacks and drinks, as for dinner you might leave with a high bill and an ok-full stomach. \n\n-Pina De Nada $7: tasted a bit watery, not much flavour going on. The tapiocas were stale and had no flavour, I think it would have been nice if they were soaked in syrup, giving it a little sweet taste. \n\n-Lychee Cactus Pear Juice $6: I couldn't taste the cactus nor pear flavour, and this drink reminded me of the Lychee Aloe drink that you can buy at Asian grocery stores.\n\n-CSB (BBQ pork buns) $8: instead of the steamed CSB, these were baked. This CSB has a perfectly crispy pastry encasing the delicious and tender BBQ pork. My complaint is that my server served the last fresh batch of the buns to the table next to me, whom ordered after. Also, I didn't know these took 1 hour to be made so she should have let me know in advance. Don't tell me it will take 10-20minutes when it supposed to take 1 hour. In the end I waited 2 HOURS for the CSB....  Although these were delicious, it was $8 for only 2 buns... If they were cheaper, I would have definitely come back just for these.\n\n-grandpa's fun guo $9: Really good, the fillings were seasoned nicely with a hint of earthiness from the truffles. \n\n-octopus $16: octopus pieces were grilled to perfection and wonderfully soft. The asian take on the chimichurri sauce was really good as well! It was refreshing and tangy with a hint of citrus, which brighten up the dish. By the way, I swear baked chicken skin is the new \"bacon\", you can just eat it on its own as a snack. While the octopus has little flavour, paired with the salty chicken skin and the chimichurri, it was just plain amazing. I normally don't like eggplant and for some reason I enjoyed it with this dish! The texture was almost like a mash, provided a hint of bitterness with all the components of the dish.\n\n-beef tongue $16:I didn't enjoy this dish. For me the oysters and beef tongue didn't go well together and this dish lacked flavors. Albeit it is a bit spicy and the pickles were amazing, but the beef tongue were too dry and there wasn't enough sauce to rescue it.\n\n-ceviche $18: I really like ceviche, but this dish didn't have that bright and refreshing taste of a ceviche. There was too much vinegar and the sauce was too creamy to enjoy.\n\n-salmon belly $18: The salmon was really tender and flavorful, with a slight crispy skin. The rice was undercooked and cold, not warm, just stone cold... But the sauce was a bit sweet and not too salty, almost like a teriyaki sauce?\n\n-crispy smoked milk $8: didn't enjoy it. I understand since it is smoked milk, you will definitely taste...the smoke... if you know what I mean. The smoke \"scent\" or \"taste\" was really strong that it lingers in my mouth in an unpleasant way, which gave the pastry a very bitter taste. In my opinion, if the chef used apple or other type of woods, it would have been better. The smoke will be more light and delicate, which wouldn't have overpowered the dish. The malted ice-cream and lemon zest left a refreshing aftertaste and helped to balance that bitter taste of the smoked milk.", "business_id": "e178giuAicIhb16ymOtiBg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-04-22", "useful": 3, "cool": 1}, {"funny": 1, "user_id": "xYciRtVZ1PW4IxSX4oJ1aw", "review_id": "BVddoV8XCJJPwc7mS9EVHg", "text": "2.5/5. \n\nI went here for the Summerlicious lunch. Upon entering the restaurant, I was impressed at how spacious it was! \n\nNormally for Summerlicious, I tend to pick the most expensive main course so it will worth the money lol. With that said, this time I chose the ravioli as my main since the steak will probably give me itis after lunch :(.\n\nOverall thought: lunch was okay, but not spectacular. None of the items on their lunch menu jumped out to me as special. Since we had 12 people, there was also a service charge so our bill came to almost $40... which were probably the most expensive lunch I ever had.\n\n-East Coast Seafood Escabeche: \nThe seafood was cooked perfectly, and by marinating them in vinegar and olive oil, it gave the seafood a deliciously sharp tang. The watermelon and capers toned down the tanginess of the seafood with theirs sweetness and saltiness flavors, respectively. However, I felt the chili was not needed as the dish turned out to be too spicy. Don't get me wrong, I love spicy food but the heat from the chili lingered in my mouth, and prevented me from tasting other flavors.\n\n-Lemon Basil Ravioli: \nThe ravioli had a perfect ratio of fillings to dough, and I believe the filling was ricotta cheese, yum! Unfortunately there were only 2 dots of the lemon basil sauce on the plate, hence I couldn't taste the sauce at all :(. The tomato ragout was just like any other regular tomato pasta sauce that I could have made. Also, I'm not sure why there were a few pieces of candied walnuts as they didn't go well with the savory ravioli at all... \n\n-Corn meal crusted Halibut: \nFriend loved it but the halibut was overcooked. Moreover, for me anything crusted with cornmeal is pretty much tasteless, so I was expecting the sauce to deliver a big punch of flavor, but I was quite disappointed...\n\n-Strawberry Bavarois: \nI didn't get to try, but my friend seemed to enjoy it. I was quite curious of how the black pepper would go with the bavarois though\n\n-Triple Layered Chocolate Mousse: \nI ordered the mousse and it was not overly sweetened, however it wasn't bad nor awful. The mousse itself had a dense texture and strong chocolate flavor. The first layer was jello or something, I just can't quite put my finger on it but it was good! The top layer was tangy and really helped to cut down the rich chocolate mousse.", "business_id": "U1RvFnS-j6ItZ8VJGyncog", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-07-12", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "xYciRtVZ1PW4IxSX4oJ1aw", "review_id": "Mj6ar5HQJuPCvZ5J46jsbg", "text": "Nice concept but food isn't that great.

I thought the potato waffle would be light and crisp, similar to latkes, instead I found the texture to be quite mussy. The poached egg is fine, I mean, you can't call yourself a brunch place if you mess up a poached egg anyways.\n\nMy friend got the Spicy chicken waffle for $12 and the chicken was dry and bland, no sign of jalapeno at all.", "business_id": "zo_z6lMRcwHqQF_Z1VZLpg", "stars": 2, "date": "2016-05-16", "useful": 1, "cool": 1}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "xYciRtVZ1PW4IxSX4oJ1aw", "review_id": "0pIzi38_HnTF91YbkcJvtw", "text": "*the restaurant opens as early as 7AM and as late as 2AM (!), thus there will always be something here for everybody at any time of the day.\n\n*I have been here twice at different times and the service has always been impeccable - very attentive and professional. \n\n*Though the portions were quite small, the food was incredibly fresh and the prices were appropriate for the quality and richness of the food.\n\n-Caffee Bombon (Espresso, dulce de leche) - $5.50\nIf there's anyone who likes sweet coffee, this caffee bombon is for you. Normally the bombon is made with condensed milk but the barista at Bar Buca used dulce de leche instead.\n\n-Uova Rossa (duck egg yolk, bay scallop, pine nuts, crisp prosciutto, scallion) - $13\nThe egg here is a bit more \"wet\" and runny than your normal omelette. Gently mix the egg with some scallop, then tops it all off with some crunchy prosciutto and pine nuts. Accompanied with 2 slices of grilled bread, this dish was one of my favorites at Bar Buca. Everything was perfectly seasoned and went well together, there was an explosion of flavors in my mouth.\n\n-stuffed focaccia porchetta -$12 \nIt's quite a heavy dish and I would suggest sharing it as the sandwich would've been too filling for one person! Though it was quite oily, the sandwich had a perfect balance between savoury and sweetness. There was moist, delicious roast pork between crispy, fluffy focaccia with a tangy apple mostarda to balance the savoury meet. I am drooling just thinking about it...\n\n-Cannoli - $2.95\nThe cannoli was also another reason why I felt in love with Bar Buca. It had a delicate, crispy shell with light yet creamy filling. There was also a lovely citrus hints from the candied orange and pistachio within the ricotta. It was the perfect way to end the meal!", "business_id": "CZY3743GpOOhdDJu6UmPBA", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-12-23", "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "xYciRtVZ1PW4IxSX4oJ1aw", "review_id": "QCavwbk45GYGF533-PEY6g", "text": "The concept of seafood boil is to get messy, no utensils are provided..

Captain's Boil was just pure raw garlic sauce... Garlic breath alert!! \n\n-Mussel with sweet corn and sausage (Garlic Sauce - a bit spicy)\nI love how the garlic sauce wasn't overpowering with just a hint of heat - complimented perfectly with the well-cooked mussels!\n\n-Clams with sweet corn and sausage (house sauce - mild spicy)\nThese were a bit annoying to eat at times as I would get empty shells at times and have to dig through the bag for those tiny clams. Otherwise, the house sauce was flavorful but it was spicier than what I expected! I'm not too sure what kind of spices they used here, but there was a hint of cumin that lingered at the back of my throat. \n\n-Craw fish with sweet corn and sausage (cajun sauce - mild spicy)\nAnyhow, to eat crawfish, after you peel the tail you must try sucking the head! It's not gross at all, you are simply tasting the juice from the boil combined with some of the fat from the crawfish. The crawfish was cooked well they were able to soak up that delicious cajun sauce.\n\n-Baked Lobster\nThere was a thick layer of creamy cheese and mayonnaise on top of a perfectly cooked lobster. I love that they pre-cracked the claw, so I didn't have to struggle so much to grab those sweet lobster meat out of the claws ;). I think it would have been even better if they sprinkled panko on top for some texture though. I noticed that other than the claw meat, there wasn't much lobster meat anywhere else so do take note of that.\n\n-King crab leg with sweet corn and sausage (lemon pepper sauce)\nI didn't find the lemon pepper sauce to be spicy and the pepper was almost nonexistent. They gave us extra lemon to add more flavor but I felt it wasn't needed. I like that the sauce was light and enhanced the natural sweetness of the crab meat.\n\n\n-Sizzling chicken plate (Similar to Aka teppan)\nThe portion here was smaller and I found that the meat - in this case chicken - was already cooked and the hot plate was there just to warm up the food. Nonetheless, I liked that the chicken had a light breading and the skin crisped up from the heat, while still maintained moisture on the inside.\n\n-Grilled Sweet Corn\nSimilar to MeNami. But this one was softer and not as crunchy as Menami.", "business_id": "wix4kECNVIitQZS3ufzsyA", "stars": 4, "date": "2016-03-28", "useful": 10, "cool": 3}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "xYciRtVZ1PW4IxSX4oJ1aw", "review_id": "EYs_BUOA70upas-EwrT0ww", "text": "Came here a few days after the opening and I love it! All the juices are freshly made in-house, the drinks should be stored in a fridge and they last up to 4 days. \n\nI tried the followings: Earthly; Pinakeleada; Mylkilicious; Flu Shot; Maleficient.\n\n-Earthly (Beet, Carrot, Kale, Spinach, Lettuce, Celery, Cucumber, Parsley): I didn't like it, but then I don't like more than half of the ingredients in this juice anyways...\n\n-Pinakeleada (Kale, Pineapple, Apple, Lemon, Ginger): my friend liked it, but this tasted like Kimchi juice for me LOL it even smelled like it. Instead of tasting ginger or apple, I tasted vinegar...... with a very tiny hint of citrus.\n\n-Flu Shot (Orange, Grapefruit, Lemon, Ginger, Cayenne Pepper): it is essentially a Vitamin C drink, which in my opinion is really good when you have a cold. The orange and grapefruit were very prominent in this juice, not so much the ginger though. There was a strong taste of cayenne pepper and almost non-existent ginger, which I don't mind.\n\n-Mylkilicious (Almonds, Cashews, Filtered Water, Agave Nectar, Dates, Sea Salt, Cinnamon): This was really good, not too sweet and a small hint of cinnamon, but I couldn't taste the sea salt though.\n\n-Maleficent (Activated Charcoal, Lemon, Agave Nectar, Alkaline Water): I bought this on a whim because of the color and ingredients. I mean, the juice was black!! This tasted like lemonade, which is so much better than the store-bought lemonade with all the flavor enhancers and additives. There is a balanced level of acidity and sweetness, a very refreshing drink for hot summer days.\n\nI definitely recommend this place as most of the products were quite good, friendly services and the space was nice as well. I heard they are planning to do smoothies when weather warms up, so I will definitely come back to try that!

We all decided to share this as it was huge for $13, and the drink was garnished with a fresh celery and a boiled half lobster tail! The flavors here were bold and and spicy! However I was quite disappointed with the lobster tail as it was bland and over-cooked.\n\n*Rock Lobster roll - $16 (substitute the chips with seasonal vegetables): \nFor $16 I thought the roll was a bit small, however it was filled with big juicy chunks of lobster. The seasoning on the lobster was spot on, and I liked how you still can taste the fresh lobster as it wasn't overly drenched in dressings. The roll was lightly toasted and crisp, not too greasy. The corn was just a typical buttered grill corn, nothing special. \n\n*Lobster poutine - $15: \nIt's not bad, but it's not spectacular either so don't expect too much. I didn't think the lobster made it that much better than any other poutine on the market. At least you are getting big chunks of lobster here, gravy was packed with lobster flavor and fries were crispy. But where are my cheese curds? You can't call this a poutine when there were barely any melted cheese curds...\n\n*Lobster Boil - $22.50: \nFor $22.50, this was a bit expensive. Instead of fries, we got the yukon chips on the side and wow, they were pretty much burnt and stale.

They were crispy on the outside, yet still soft and moist and not-fully-cooked on the inside. There were a big chunks of perfectly cooked and tender octopus tentacles inside each takoyaki as well! I also loved how prominent the flavor of the bonito flakes and mayonnaise were, while the takoyaki sauce was just sweet enough to balance out the flavors.\n\n-Chicken Karaage - $4.9\nThought the chicken karaage were perfectly seasoned and tasty, they weren't the best I've had. I found the karaage to be too a bit too oily and the batter wasn't as crispy as the one I had at Gushi.\n\n-White sesame shio ramen: $9.6\nFriend ordered this which came with a pestle and mortar to grind your own seeds and put into the ramen yourself. To be honest, I thought the sesame seeds didn't have the rich aroma and flavor I expected, thus it really didn't add much to the ramen. It was also quite difficult to grind the seeds, but kudos on giving this experience to their customers.\n\n-Red Dragon Ramen - $14.9\n The noodle came with a thick noodles that were bouncy and cooked in right texture. The broth had just the right amount of spiciness and it was more fatty compared to the shio or shoyu ramen. Actually, I found that the broth here had a more delicate flavor and they weren't as oily as other places - which is my personal preference when it comes to ramen broth. Their chasu is about 90% meat and 10% fat, and they tasted amazing! It was tender yet chewy at the same time. I also noticed how the bamboo shoots were pretty much the basic topping for all the ramen here.\n\nThe only complain I would have about my ramen was how salty it was, but not MSG salty! I actually had to ask the server for a bowl of plain soup to add into bowl, which should reduce the saltiness but even then, it was still too much for me to handle.", "business_id": "crstB-H5rOfbXhV8pX0e6g", "stars": 4, "date": "2016-02-22", "useful": 1, "cool": 1}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "xYciRtVZ1PW4IxSX4oJ1aw", "review_id": "VPwhBdKC3QLhshMfIrXidg", "text": "*The inside was spacious and not crazy loud in here. \n*I can actually hold a proper conversation and don't have to walk out with a major headache stare at Guu.

So kudos to their ventilation system\n\n-Takara plum wine - $11 (glass)\nThe Takara plum wine had a sweet, fruity flavor without a strong alcoholic taste. \n\n-Tori Karaage (japanese style deep fried chicken w/ house special wasabi sauce) - $12\nThe deep fried chicken was not oily, still juicy and remained succulent when cold. However it would have been better if there was a bit more batter as I found the chicken's exterior wasn't crispy enough. I really enjoyed the wasabi in the dipping sauce as it added just a kick to the chicken karaage, a delicious combination! The picked ginger and cabbage was a nice addition to tone down the heat as well.\n\n-Taco Wasabi (wasabi marinated octopus) - $8\nThe octopus was chewy, but hard, slimy (in a good way) and full of wasabi heat without leaving a burning aftertaste in my mouth. The addition of seaweed was quite nice to cut the heat, but as always, more please as there were only 5 pieces\n\n-Set A Yakitori - $16\n--Sanmainiku (pork belly): A bit too salty for me but D said it was ok for him. The pork was juicy and not too fatty, just perfect!\n--Cheese Mune (chicken breast with cheese): The chicken was dry and bland. The cheese didn't really help either.\n--Eringi (king mushroom): King mushroom don't have much flavor so it needs a lot of \"help.\" Again this was bland..\n--Karubi (beef strip loin): juicy and just melt in your mouth.\n--Scallop: cooked just right and had good seasoning.\n\n-Mochi Bacon (bacon wrapped rice cake) - $5\nIt was a bit odd to see that the rice cake was dduk (Korean rice cake) instead of mochi. Nonetheless it was probably one of the better skewer of the night. The bacon was slightly crispy and went well with the rice cake without making it too salty.\n\n-Gyu Tataki (lightly seared beef) - $16\nI thought the beef pieces were a bit too thick and tough to chew on.

It was hot and flaky, super delicious with a small hint of chives, and you can definitely tell these were homemade\n\n-Blueberry Watermelon Lychee- $5.50\n\n-Black 'n' Blue pancake - $12: These pancakes were ah-okay. I found them to be a bit denser, doughy and not as fluffy as the ones at Mildred. The pancakes were more of a plain pancake as they didn't have the blueberries incorporate within the mix, and the sauce is sweet with a hint of tartness. Nonetheless, I appreciate that they offer the syrup in a short glass as I can control how much sweetness I want. Also, the brown sugar butter was not needed, it served no purpose and didn't add any flavor to the pancakes for me.\n\n-Headmaster Omelette w/ Gorgonzola - $16: The omelette was exceptionally tender, light and moist.

The plate came with a mug of of regular hot chocolate and the special chocolate you chose in a glass. The chef coated the rim and bottom of the glass with your choice of chocolate, this way you are able to taste your chocolate before the hot chocolate mixture hits your palette.

If you see something that you like, comment on the photo to reserve that item and of course, make sure to pick it up on the same day before the store closed). \n\n-Key Lime Cream Puff - $4: \nThere are other flavors as well, such as green tea and vanilla. Steph advised that the cream puff is best to be eaten after the lid is taken off, unless you want to save it for later then store in the fridge with lid on! Before you devour the cream puff, make sure to bite from the hole where the cream was piped in, or else you will be faced with an explosion mess - you have been warned.\n\nThe cream puff was really really tasty. I liked Steph's cream puff more than Papa's beard cream puffs as I found the latter to be incredibly messy to eat. The cream puff's shell here is not too flakey and had a slight crunch, which was quite interesting. The cream itself was smooth, not too sweet and had a hint of sour taste from the key lime :).\n\n-Black sesame honey matcha cake - $6:\nThe cake itself is a bit harder than I thought, and although the flavors might seems a bit strange, the bitter green tea and nutty black sesame was a perfect combination! However I would have prefered to have more of the matcha flavor, as I found the black sesame was too rich and the sweetness from the honey was a bit overwhelming as well.\n\n-Plum & Matcha hard candy:\nAt first I disliked the initial taste, but then I decided to keep the candy in my mouth longer, it starts to get sweet inside. It's like eating a sour and salty plum then it slowly get better and sweeter. Though I couldn't detect the matcha flavor, I don't mind it as much as the candy is actually quite addicting!\n\n-Iced matcha latte - $4.75:\nPetit Nuage was recently crowned as having the best green tea latte in Toronto, so of course I have to get it on all my visits ;). Steph told me the matcha powder that she used is imported from Japan, and it is not being sell anywhere in Canada but Steph has the connection :p. Interestingly she said all high grade matcha powder should be stored in the fridge to preserve the powder, if someone tell you otherwise, that means the matcha powder is not a good quality one! The iced matcha latte at Petit Nuage was really refreshing and not too sweet (you can ask her to add more syrup if you like). It had a deep, vegetal taste, a strong aroma and a lingering sweetness that leaves your mouth watering.\n\n-Macarons: \nPetit Nuage sells a box of 6 macarons for $12, whereas a box a dozen is $25. In general I found that the macarons at Petit Nuage can be more sweet compared to other macarons I have had in the city. Their macarons are perfectly made in terms of texture.\n\n*Strawberry Basil: This is a seasonal (summer) flavor and it was really good! There was strawberry jelly in the middle with a sweet basil ganache.\n*Vanilla Rose: the rose flavor is a bit too strong and I felt it was clashing with the sweet vanilla, which made this macaron too sweet for my taste.\n*Yuzu Honey: I wished the yuzu flavor was a bit stronger since it didn't have a lot of that tangy, tart note but overall it's really good! A must try!\n*Hong Kong milk tea: tasted just like a cup of good old HK milk tea. A favourite!\n*Jasmine Apricot: understated jasmine and apricot flavor. Not too sweet, It's like drinking a nice cup of jasmine tea with apricot syrup.\n*Uji Matcha: My favorite! The moment you bite into it, you get a gentle mouth feel of green tea (matcha) flavour along with the slight bitter ganache.\n*Roasted tea and Persimmon: strong roasted tea flavor with (I believe) a subtle persimmon jam in the middle.\n*Milky Earl Grey: I'm not sure what is the filling here, but there was only a slight hint of earl grey and I felt the filling overpowered the tea flavor.\n*Lemon Lavender: I usually don't like lavender as too much of it can taste like a hand soap, but this macaron had a strong lemon flavor with a faint taste of lavender. One of my favourite!\n*Coconut Pineapple: Not too sweet with a strong taste of coconut until you get that slight tartness from the pineapple jam and coconut bits.", "business_id": "XC23vvqHdCJqev-bmeh2HQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-08-28", "useful": 4, "cool": 3}, {"funny": 1, "user_id": "xYciRtVZ1PW4IxSX4oJ1aw", "review_id": "3xhFDXUsB9EqF65x1WjkTg", "text": "3.5/5\n\n*The restaurant was spacious and spotless! I liked how they had a big sink at the front with sensors so you wouldn't have to use the washroom and dirtied the handles.\n\n*there were bibs, paper towels and plastic gloves on the table.\n\n*service was average, not the most attentive. \n\n*I would not come back to Captain's Boil on a regular basis as it's quite expensive. \n\n-Lobster ($29.95) and Shrimp ($12.95) in Captain's Boil sauce: \nThe lobster was cut lengthwise, and both the shrimp and lobster were cooked perfectly. While I understand the concept of the restaurant was to use your hands, but at some point it was extremely difficult to eat the lobster without lobster crackers. Half way through eating we also realized that there was no where to put the trash/empty shells. \n\nWhile the Captain's Boil sauce was supposed to be the combination of all three sauces, the garlic was overwhelming. I love garlic but this was way too much and the sauce was under-seasoned for our taste. I also thought the shrimps had much more sauce and flavor compared to the lobster, perhaps the shrimp was smaller hence the sauce was able to penetrate easier?\n\nHalf-way through I decided to order the Cajun Fries. I thought the fries were quite crispy and fluffy on the inside, but it felt very.. powdery? They could have better distributed the cajun seasoning by tossing the fries as it seemed they were just sprinkled on top.", "business_id": "bLtC8xJXkd1b6MT0KjnSvw", "stars": 3, "date": "2016-01-07", "useful": 5, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "xYciRtVZ1PW4IxSX4oJ1aw", "review_id": "9zCG39vQcW07-8wHIEJYFw", "text": "*Crave Healthy Habits is a chain that aims to serve healthy food choices that are both nutritious and tasty, yet at affordable prices.\n\n*I can't speak for their salad, but the breakfast boxes are affordable, delicious and very nutritious! \n\n*Despite locating in a food court, Crave is spacious and very modern looking, which is completely different than other stores in the same food court.\n\n* Because of the open kitchen concept, you can see all the fruits are freshly prepared right in front of your eyes. Occasionally Crave will run out of certain fruit, and the staff have always happily given me more of any fruit that I want, such as strawberry!\n\n*Do note that Crave only sell their breakfast boxes from 7AM to 11AM with the exception to the yogurt parfait, and all other items on the menu is for lunch from 11AM to closing.\n\n-Time Oat -$5: \n I have always asked to substitute pecans with almonds on all my orders, and I'm sure the staff have known me by now because of this lol. The rolled oats were soft and warm, not too mushy or gluey. I found the texture of the strawberry avocado puree is more of a syrup, which is actually even better as I felt a creamier puree might be too heavy and filling for this. Although it was quite bland on its own, but mix it well and the natural sweetness from the fruits and the sweet puree really boost up the flavor of the rolled oats.\n\n-Morning Run - $5: \nAnother really heathy and high protein choice! Again, loved the natural sweetness from the fruits and I like how there was just a touch of maple syrup, so the entire dish isn't too sweet. I believe the yogurt is sugar-free as well and it was just a bit tangy. The lemon curd was such a nice surprise addition and it really gave a nice zing to wake you up in the morning! However I prefer the Time oat than morning run as I found Time Oat to be more filling yet not too heavy in the tummy :).\n\n-Yogurt Parfait - $4: \nFor $4 the portion was huge and it's actually even cheaper than the ones at Tim Hortons or Starbucks! I believe the parfait at those two shops cost around $3-4 and they aren't exactly healthy lol... Note that the yogurt parfait is available throughout the day so if you are looking for a mid-day snack that is similar to the morning run, get this!\n\n-Santorini - $5: \nOther than yogurt or rolled oats, Crave also offer toasts for breakfast as well. I actually only got this once and I'm not sure if $5 for this is justifiable. I guess it could be, but the portion was a bit smaller and I felt I can get something bigger like the rolled oats for the same price? Don't get me wrong though, this was absolutely delicious!  The fresh pomegranate seeds gave a slight crunch with every bite and really cut down the creaminess of the avocado. The puree was creamy and fresh, along with the distinctive sour flavor of the bread and drizzled with just right amount of olive oil, it was quite filling and satisfying!", "business_id": "DkBer3JjUGfKEsZCLtfgvA", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-09-11", "useful": 2, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "xYciRtVZ1PW4IxSX4oJ1aw", "review_id": "1WlY_eI-wNDwCrVvkyUhSA", "text": "*tend to sell out of their more popular items so do get here early\n*small selections but that mean each pastry was handled with great care and love\n*Located in a quiet neighbourhood with great coffee shops around, good place for a date \n\n-Strawberry Rose Soft Serve -$5 *Only for Valentine's day\nThe strawberry was actually more prominent while the rose was subtle, coming through just at the end and added a depth and complexity to this beautiful soft serve. The heart cookies were just regular butter cookies but it was a nice romantic touch for Valentine's Day :\n\n-Banana Eclair Pie Eclair - $7\nEven more expensive than Nugateau. They probably used another dough to coat the eclair so that once it bakes, the shell will crisp up! With every bite, you are getting a combination of different textures here, from a slight crunch of the shell to a delicate and creamy ganache. The banana pieces are caramelized, de-glazed with rum and flamb\u00e9. \n\n-The Chocolate One - $7.5\nSince the owner used dark chocolate, the cake was quite rich and heavy but if you are a dark chocolate lover (like myself) - this is the cake for you! I loved the different layers in this cake: from the mousse to cake with dark chocolate pieces at the end - finish off with some crispy pearls in between for some crunch!", "business_id": "fGdUxfeEWp9pn2sAa9rv2w", "stars": 5, "date": "2016-04-07", "useful": 5, "cool": 2}, {"funny": 1, "user_id": "xYciRtVZ1PW4IxSX4oJ1aw", "review_id": "nLePIvaVA1fw8vCScyl6nw", "text": "I'm quite surprised to see such a nice spa like Discovery Day in Markham, cuz you know, some of the spas in Markham is a bit .. sketch LOL :D. \n\nI received a manicure - $20 and a relaxation full body massage (45 mins for $50) during my stay here. \n\nOnce I arrived to the spa, I noticed the entrance had a slipper rack and you can leave your shoes there.

I noticed they didn't offer me a complimentary tea or coffee though. I had to ask for water, but that's not a big deal for me. The room was dimly lighted with a nice & relaxing music in the background. In the room, I was instructed to strip (lol I swear the spa is not sketch, I was allowed to wear underwear) and lie down with my back facing upwards. The lady who was going to provide me with the massage came in and I told her of specific area where I needed her to focus on. I also advised her to avoid my arm where my tattoo was healing. I thought the overall massage was relaxing and and I felt quite refreshed afterwards :). I liked how they respected your privacy by knocking on the door for permission prior to entering the room as well. \n\nThe manicure was really nice. I thought the table was not as clean as I wanted.

Since it was only two of us for dinner and most dishes at Byblos were tapas, we weren't able to cover most of the menu. Thus despite my low rating of Byblos, I'm willing to come back to give it another chance and try other offerings on their menu.\n\n-Organic House Labneh (fennel, honey, olive oil, Barbari Bread) - $10\nThe barbari bread arrived piping hot and crispy, and it was quite salty to eat on its own. However the bread itself paired perfectly with the sweet honey and tangy yogurt in the labneh. The labneh was silky and smooth, a bit peppery and had a lovely cooling sensation.\n\n-Lamb Ribs (Dukkah, Buttermilk Sauce, Carob Molasses, Red Chili Schug) - $14\nThe ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and had great flavor. A bit spicy but it was balanced by the sweet buttermilk sauce. The thick crunchy layer coating of dukkah added a nice texture and helped to mask the overtly mutton-like flavor.\n\n-Steak Tartare (Roasted Red Chili, Mint, Labneh, Barbari Bread) - $18\nThe texture was just melt-in-your-mouth goodness and beyond buttery. With that said, the red chilies overpowered the delicate flavor of the beef and there wasn't enough labneh to balance out the spicy notes.\n\n-Tuna Ceviche (Green Schug, Cr\u00e8me Fraiche Buttermilk, Squid Ink Chip) - $17\nThe squid ink chips were slightly salted and had the perfect bite sizes. Both Karen and I didn't like the texture of tuna as it was quite \"hard\" to chew. I also thought there wasn't enough lime to bring out the freshness of dish, and the avocado didn't really work well with the tuna either.\n\n-Turkish Manti Dumplings (Smokey Eggplant, Yogurt Sauce, Molasses) - $14\nThe Turkish Manti Dumpling had an addictive thyme based yogurt sauce and the molasses gave them a touch of sweetness. The dumplings were perfect cooked with a thin shell and filled with eggplant. I didn't mind that you can't really taste the eggplant. I always hated the taste and texture of it, thus I was surprised to see how well they were able to \"mask\" the eggplant taste with not too much smokiness.\n\n-Hand rolled couscous (Brown Butter, Saffron, Herbs) - $6\nOn the initial bite, the couscous tasted a bit bland but it was really fluffy! The herbs and saffron flavors didn't come through, however I thought the couscous was perfectly paired with the yogurt sauce from the manti dumplings.\n\n-Pavlova (Rose Pastry Cream, Pomegranate Molasses, Fig, Pashmak) - $12\nNot too sweet. I thought the outer shell of the Pavlova was a bit hard to crack, otherwise the inner layers were soft and creamy. It reminded me of what I would imagine a baked marshmallow to taste like. I liked how the rose fragrance was not too overpowering and the slight tangy-ness from the fig helped to balance out the sweetness of the pavlova. Unlike normal cotton candy, the pashmak had a wool-like texture, almost like Asian pork floss and it just melted in your mouth.", "business_id": "Yl2TN9c23ZGLUBSD9ks5Uw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-12-23", "useful": 4, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "xYciRtVZ1PW4IxSX4oJ1aw", "review_id": "5Ybx7WT2XAV8awx3FlB2tg", "text": "*Service is not attentive.

I expected it to be a little dry but it was so moist and tender on the inside. Amazingly crispy enough on the outside and seasoned perfectly. Highly recommended!\n\n-Deep fried goldmember (golden fried morsels of squid served with house-made kanpai cocktail sauce) - $7\nThe squid was also tasty, but after ordering the popcorn chicken, the dish felt a little repetitive as it shared the same breading and sweet chili sauce as the popcorn chicken.\n\n-mc hammer (Taiwanese popcorn chicken with fried basil leaf in Ike's secret blend of herbs and spices) - $7\nThere wasn't too much breading and each nugget is well-seasoned. Juicy and tender pieces of chicken that kept its crunch? Too good, especially paired with that side of sweet chili sauce. Try having a piece with the fried Thai basil leaves, they added a hint of aromatic that makes it outstanding. Delish!\n\n-The o.g. bao (original night market sammie with slow-cooked 5-spice pork, taiwanese relish, pickled cabbage, teriyaki shoyu, crushed peanuts) - $6\nThe pork belly was marinated in a typical 5 spice with a crunchy and balancing slaw. The only thing I didn't like was the meat was mostly fat. In addition, I'd like this bao more if they added more sauce to it.\n\n-kung-pao cauliflower (stir-fried with roasted peanuts and dry chili) - $6\nThe kung-pao cauliflower at Kanpai was nothing like the one I had at Thoroughbred at all. The dish was saucy, bland and the cauliflower was undercooked. It was not kung pao style at all, flavour-wise.\n\n-Can you hear me now (charcuterie-style marinated pig ears tossed in house-made taiwanese chili oil) - $5\nUnfortunately the pig ears were sliced too thick and bland. The chili oil didn't come through either and all I tasted was the heat from the raw green onions.\n\n-Fu Manchu (crispy morsels of house-fried tofu tossed in a light sweet chili sauce) - $5\nI'm not sure if this was supposed to be served cold but the tofu had a crispy skin and soft on the inside.

My experience at Nota Bene wasn't good and I wouldn't return in the future. It was not worth the $45 price tag for the dinner. The portion size was a hit and miss, service was OK, but the food was bland for me.\n\n*My Friend courses: \n-Quebec Duck & Foie Gras Terrine: The entr\u00e9e came in a delightfully arranged plate of foie gras. There was a piece of pistachio granola that came with the dish. It definitely complemented the taste of the goose very well. \n\n-Tongue & Cheek: The 'tongue in cheek' had two types of meat arranged very nicely: the beef cheek and the veal tongue confit. It came with a potato pancake placed underneath the veal and sprinkled feta cheese. I felt that both the veal and the beef cheek tasted a little bland. The feta cheese was really the only source of strong flavor, otherwise it was not very memorable.\n\n-Baked Bruce Peninsula Spy Apple: The Baked Bruce Peninsula Spy Apple was essentially apple crumble with vanilla ice cream. The presentation was very well done. The crumble was warm and tasted delicious.It wasn't too sweet and the texture was fantastic.\n\n*My courses: \n-Crispy Duck Salad: The salad had a spicy touch, yet refreshing with the green papaya and coriander, but nothing outstanding. The duck was cooked well, moist, and how can a fatty crispy duck skin not be good?! I wished the dish came with some dressing, even just some lime to tie the whole dish together as the salad was lacking in flavor. In addition, I prefer my salad to have different textures. With this, you are only getting the crunchy texture from all the ingredients, it got boring after a few bites.\n\n-Grilled Mediterranean Seabass: The fish was cooked to perfection, soft and buttery and the portion was quite generous. The escarole was too bitter for my taste, I believe they over-cooked it, and the lime didn't help to reduce the bitterness. (I understand escarole is bitter, but I have had it before when you cook it just right, the bitterness is not as prevalent).  The bitterness from the escarole over-powered the fish. The broth was bland and beans were tough (under-cooked), just not good at all...\n\n-Clementine Sorbet: The portion was tiny! It's like the size of a golf ball. The sorbet was very light and refreshing, it tasted like those frizzy vitamin c drink that I used to drink when I was a child :). The yogurt crisp was okay, I wish there was something sweet to compliment the sour sorbet though.", "business_id": "AercPW1B2YVNK3UsiPDkTg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-03-04", "useful": 5, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 1, "user_id": "xYciRtVZ1PW4IxSX4oJ1aw", "review_id": "v91A3gQU0CmJ38_AHNwLcA", "text": "Small cozy cafe with local arts for sale.

If you are planning to come here, look for the fluorescent Taro Cards & Palm Reading sign... a bit mysterious (and amusing) but it really adds to their \"speakeasy\" vibe. Apparently the story behind that sign was that there used (or maybe still there) to be a lady who did palm reading/tarot cards next to the bar's entrance.\n\n*Their drinks are a bit on the stronger side, however they are good and say hi to the handsome and friendly bartender Matt when you are there!\n\n*Mac n Cheese Balls: \nDeep fried Mac n Cheese balls?! These were super duper delicious with the gooey and flavorful mac & cheese packed tight inside the ball. The outside was crispy and the chipotle Sriracha sauce provided just a hint of spice, and that rich cheese sauce? Yummmmmm.\n\n*Charcuterie Board - Prosciutto Cotto, Guanciale, Capicollo, Spicy Sopressata, Parmigiano, marinated mushrooms, fried kale, crostini with tomato and rosemary jam: \nTo be honest, I'm not a fan of kale but uhhh I'm hooked! These kale chips were lightly salted and not greasy, I can easily eat a whole bowl of this. Everything on this board were tasty but I must mention, that homemade tomato jam was the highlight on that board! It had a perfect balance of sweet and savoury and intense tomato flavor. The chef should bottled up this jam and sell in the bar, seriously!\n\n*Pork & Potato Slaw - Soy ginger lime vinaigrette, house smoked pork, potato skin chips, bbq chips, pickled ginger, green onion, avocado crema: \nOn my initial bites, I didn't enjoy the slaws much as I got huge chunks of pickled ginger, just like the ones you would find in sushi restaurants. However I realized it was my fault for not mixing up the contents well enough, so use those chopsticks and keep mixing! The pulled pork was delicious, however I wish there was more potato chips and slaws for that nice crunch. Overall it was an okay dish as I felt there were too much flavors clashing with each other.\n\n*Falafel Blinis - Chickpea blini, cinnamon date jam, house falafel, pickled beats and radish, bitter melon candy, fennel cumin tahini\nThe falafel blinis was my least favourite dish, as I found the falafel to be a bit too dry and I couldn't really taste the different layer of flavors.\n\n*Gnocchi Poutine - fried gnocchi, root veg gravy, cheddar and parmigiano blend, green onion and fried shallots:\nThis dish was a different take on the classic poutine and I really enjoyed it. The gnocchi was pillowy-soft and stuffed with a cheesy cheddar and parmigiano blend. Again, a bit more sauce would have been nice, however a really nice dish and the fried shallots added some texture to the it.\n\n*oreo cream dessert from Junked Food Co: \nThere were layers of cream and oreo, however I felt there was too much cream and too sweet, so a lot of people were unable to finish it\n\n*Whisky Sour: \nThe cocktail was HEAVENLY by the way, I think I just found my new favourite cocktail!

I came here on a weekday before and restaurant was packed. Their dinner menu change quite often based on seasons. They also have a whole-animal dinner which I really wanna try! Overall service is not that good. Servers aren't friendly and they will rush you, especially during brunch. For dinner I had the following: \n\n-bison flank $18: The taste was very similar to beef and it did not taste gamey. There was quite a bit of heat which I think came from the smoke harissa and the black garlic added a hint of sweetness, which paired well with the bison.\n\n-scallops $18: the scallops had a nice golden brown crust and had a tender, springy center. I liked the slightly sweet quince BBQ sauce which accentuated the earthiness flavor of the hazelnut and did not overwhelmed the natural taste of the juicy scallops.\n\n**Brunch - no reservation and come early! Restaurant is really small and get filled up quickly. \n Also, get the DONUTS if they are still available. I hate dessert and Rachelle's donut was probably the best I have had so far! Not too sweet with a nice texture :). For brunch I had the followings: \n\n-poutine $12: The light and fluffy yet chewy potato gnocchi was covered in a delectable gravy and pulled pork. You really can't go wrong adding a melting cheese curds to an already great dish, and I love how the curds still maintained its squeakiness and volume.\n\n-huevos rancheros $14: There's nothing like a runny golden fried egg, tomato sauce packed with flavors, and fresh corn tortillas to start my morning. It would have been better if they didn't skimp on the avocados, because you know, who doesn't love to bite into big creamy chunks of avocado!\n\n-crispy pork hocks $14: The pork hocks had a super crispy skin yet when you bite into them, these were incredibly soft and tender. Love how the chef balanced out the fatty pork hocks with a mildly spicy and sour kimchi. Salad wasn't drenched in dressings but potato is not consistent, can be overdone sometimes. \n\n-the bruce leroy $14: Golden brown crispy skin and perfectly cooked chicken thigh. The biscuit was quite dry. I actually found the sweet soy sauce to be overpowering and the sandwich became incredibly salty after a few bite", "business_id": "mBOIef7a4hONEbSi_ai8Bw", "stars": 4, "date": "2016-05-03", "useful": 5, "cool": 1}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "xYciRtVZ1PW4IxSX4oJ1aw", "review_id": "sAucybT8MzLN7NKr4DyhBw", "text": "4.5/5\n\n*Service isn't that good as there was only one server in the restaurant. \n*I don't recommend going here with a big group as the restaurant is extremely cramped. \n\n-Live Uni - $25\nI'm an uni fanatic and this was the best I've had in Toronto so far. The uni was amazingly fresh and creamy, had a slight taste of the sea and was not fishy at all.\n\n-Botan Shrimp Nigiri - $9 for 2 nigiri\nNot only the shrimp was fresh and slightly sweet, the chef also deep fried the shrimp heads and boy, was it amazing!!\n\n-Horse Mackerel Nigiri - $8 for 2 Nigiri\nThe Aji didn't have a strong fishy taste and had a mild oily texture. The fish was served with fresh grated ginger and scallions to counteract the fishy taste and left a light aftertaste on the palate.\n\n-Hokkaido Scallop Sashimi - $8 for 2 nigiri\n The fact that it was seared helped to elevate the taste and richness in the fish oil. The torch increased the temperature and slightly changed the texture of the scallop yet it was not too firm nor overcooked\n\n-Bluefin Tuna Belly Nigiri - $16\nThe bluefin tuna belly was pricey ($16) for two pieces, but I'd say try it once if you're looking to splurge. Since the fish was seared, it released all the fatty oils which gave the fish a buttery and melts in your mouth goodness...\n\n-Spider Roll - $11\nThe spider roll was much smaller than the ones I had at other restaurants and had a different taste, more delicate, refined and less batter.\n\n-Japango Roll - $13\nThe Japango roll is a California roll topped with seared salmon and scallop drizzled in their special sauce and spicy oil.

Also the breading wasn't crispy, but still good! \n\nI got the seaweed one and to be honest I thought the chicken wasn't bad, but once you get to the center, the chicken is quite dry due to a thicker cut so you will definitely need a dipping sauce. My friend ended up using his left-over Popeyes dipping sauce cuz the chicken was too dry for his liking lol.

They were quite possible the best calamari I have had in Toronto so far. The squid was moist and tender while the crust were still crispy, a nice squeeze of lemon and a sprinkling of salt, these are set.\n\n-Pappardelle alla Iosa (homemade spicy sausage, button & oyster mushrooms, peas, parmigiano, extra-virgin olive oil) - $18\nThe pasta was al-dente and though the sausage wasn't as spicy as expected, but for some reason I liked it that way? The pasta wasn't overloaded with too many flavors and in my opinion, when it comes to a really good pasta the key is to have it simple, elegant and key flavors stand out.\n\n-Pizza del Giorno (white pizza with light mozzarella, house made spicy sausage, fresh burrata, and black truffle shavings) - $20?\nGotta love thin crust and the one at Terroni was done just right with a good amount of toppings - the portion was perfect to share between 2-3 people!

The texture of the pancake was too doughy, dense and almost rubbery. I thought the portion was quite small for $14, but it was a good sized portion without making you feeling stuffed.

I LOVE this drink. Surprisingly it doesn't taste fruity. The taste is very unique: naturally sweet, taste like a mocha but with a herbal finish. \n\n*Food: \n-poutine -$8: The portion was huge! I enjoyed this dish but unfortunately I couldn't taste the cheese. For me the cheese curds are a big part of poutine, but again this is a pure vegetarian poutine, so I can look past that. The fries were thick and I believe they were baked, but I wished they were a bit more crispy though.The gravy is made from smoked mushrooms and it was not too heavy, quite light and very smooth.\n\n-bbq burger - $12:  The onion rings were well cut, not like the skinny pitiful stringy type of onion rings. They were coated with puffed quinoa batter and fried (or baked?), really crispy and delicious! I didn't get to try the burger but my friend loved it.\n\n-Buddha Fresh Bowl - baby size with soba noodle - $11.50: quite disappointed with this dish. Luckily I chose the baby size too, as the normal size would have costed me $17. The tofu steaks tasted like cooked meat. The marinade for this dish was on point and it was cooked to perfection. The peanut sauce overpowers the ingredients and made the dish really heavy. I suppose the fresh vegetables (tomato, cucumber, bean sprouts) were supposed to cut down the heaviness of the dish, but it did little to nothing. My friend tried it and she agreed that the dish was really heavy as well. Furthermore, the soba noodles were overcooked and turned soggy. In my opinion, the soba noodles should be cooked, rinsed and served cold for this dish to work. Because the noodles were hot and sat at the bottom of the bowl, the noodles continued cooking, while soaking the peanut sauce, which made the noodles soggy. I ended up eating the tofu steaks and picked pieces of vegetables to eat lol.\n\nOverall, while my experience wasn't good, I would come back and try other dishes. If you don't know what to order, I recommend ordering the burgers and quinoa onion rings.

I was actually provided with a SET TASTING MENU that day. \n\n-\"Shake N shake\" salad: \nYou put the ingredients into a glass jar with lettuce then shake it. Seems a bit gimmicky imo. The salad was incredibly sweet from the raisins and sweet corn, thus making it an odd way to start the meal. \n\n-Chili Salmon Soup \nThe soup was incredibly spicy and the salmon was overcooked as well. \n\n-Taste of Life (matsukasa pork shoulder with four secret dressings)\nThe four secret dressings are: bitter, sweet, sour, salty. Good concept and the pork shoulder had a nice ratio of fat to meat, but the meat itself was quite bland. Except for the salty sauce, the rest didn't pair well with the pork belly at all.\n\n-Shangtang Abalone\nThe broth was flavorful and light which complimented the tender and slightly chewy abalone. \n\n-Divine Flame Signature Beef Noodle \nAAA prime steak was seared in front of our eyes. The noodle had a chewy and firm texture while the beef shank was incredibly tender. However I thought the soup was quite bland and spicy, it didn't have any depth of flavor at all.\n\n-Teppanyaki Rice with Curry Chicken \nSimilar to Aka Teppan. Curry had a nice kick to it, I thought the chicken was dry and bland.\n\n-Snack Bun \nHow is this fine dining or creative if you give me a piece of white toast for a snack bun? Where's my steamed bao!  I could have made this at home with more toppings. Luckily the beef stir fry was juicy and flavorful, otherwise this would have been a bland dish as no sauce was accompanied.\n\n-White Fungus Nectar \nThough the overall soup was not too sweet and the flowers didn't have that overbearing floral scents. It was too simple and they should have paired the dessert with other ingredients to add more flavor, taste and texture to the sweet soup. However due to its simplicity, it worked well with the tasting menu as the previous dishes was quite heavy. But as a dessert on its own, the flavor was not there.\n\n-Mango Panna Cotta\nThis smooth and decadent panna cotta was pretty much irresistible. I liked that they kept the panna cotta itself almost non-sweetened, which paired well with the sweet mango sauce.", "business_id": "BwbPzuEuIN_oFmNRJIgHlg", "stars": 2, "date": "2016-04-11", "useful": 8, "cool": 1}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "xYciRtVZ1PW4IxSX4oJ1aw", "review_id": "-7KzqzpMqGw6sCxRxb5zbQ", "text": "You know, I can't believe I'm actually reviewing food-court food lol... \n\nKaiju is one of those unexpected hidden gem located in the food court area of the Aura condo, and most of their items range from $6 to $10 with a few exceptions. To get here, simply go down the escalator, turn left until you see a tea store then turn right, and you will see a food court with only 3 vendors.\n\nBeing a food court restaurant, I didn't expect good service or anything, but the owners are some of the friendliest people I have ever know. Everytime I went, they always took the time to explain the type of food Kaiju offers and made sure I have a pleasant experience.\n\n*Chicken Katsu Curry - $8\nThe chicken katsu came out piping hot and fresh as Kaiju deep fried the katsu per order. I liked how they placed the katsu on the rice with no sauce poured over, so the meat wasn't going to get soggy easily. Unlike other restaurants, the chicken katsu at Kaiju were lightly breaded, and left a good amount of thickness of the chicken meat, which allowed it to stay moist. The chicken was crunchy and tender on the inside, and the coleslaw was surprisingly  good! The curry itself was smooth and not too thin. I also liked that the curry had a nice transition of sweetness to spiciness, and the spices didn't get muddled among the sweetness of the curry. Overall I actually prefered Kaiju's curry over Gyugyuya on Dundas street.\n\n*Malaysian Char Keow Tiau - $8.95: \nI thought this was just an average stir fried noodles dish and it was incredibly salty. My throat was craving for water after having a few bites, so I felt they used a lot of MSG for this dish :(.\n\n*Tofu cheesecake:\nAnother reason why I love coming to Kaiju is their tofu cheesecake and the regular Japanese cotton cheesecake. Although the Japanese cheesecake is bigger and a bit more expensive, trust me, the cake tasted exactly the same as Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake. However for both cakes, Kaiju only sell them by slices on Saturday, otherwise you have to place an order in advance for the cakes.\n\nThe base is a thin layer of gram crackers and brown sugar I believe. Although the base is quite sweet, the top layer of unsweetened tofu nicely balanced out the sweetness from the base.

However I do prefer my guac to have a bit more lime and good chunks of avocado to give it more texture.\n\n-Chorizo Taco\nThe chorizo was seasoned perfectly - slightly spicy but not in a burning hot sensation. A hint of saltiness from the tangy queso fresco went well with the chorizo and the pico de gallo added that dose of freshness to the taco. The flavor really can't be beat, and it's definitely a must try if you haven't already.\n\n-Baja Fish Taco\nfish was lightly breaded and still able to hold its shape. ! I appreciated how they kept the taco refreshing by not drenching the slaw in dressings and the fish was not oily at all. To blend everything together, just squeeze some lime juice and it was pretty much one of the best fish taco I have ever had in Toronto so far.\n\n-Chicken Hermanos Taco\nThe shredded chicken with a super sweet and spicy sauce all nestled between corn tortillas with a sprinkle of sharp red onions. Topped it all off with some juicy and sweet pineapple to tone down the heat. Are you drooling?  I'm drooling.\n\n-Tofu Taco\nSince they used firm tofu, the small bits of crunchy tofu added a nice texture to each bite and I found the overall taco to be quite sweet? I was hoping for more spices or other toppings to balance the sweetness. Tien and I decided to add their house special sauce for more flavor and oh boy, it was HOT. Later we found out it was habanero hot sauce.. so add it in moderation :)!\n\n-Barbacoa Taco\nI found the beef to be quite tough and chewy, not \"fork tender\" like what I would expected from being braised for a long time. I also thought the beef was not as flavorful as others, but I really liked the fresh pico de gallo. \n\n-Pulled Pork Taco\nOn the other hand this taco was just..ohmygosh-so-good-bursting-with-all-the-flavors-pulled-pork. The meat was soft, succulent, juicy and had that \"fall-off-the-bone\" texture. Slathered in a delicious BBQ sauce and topped it off with some crunchy slaw - It. Was. Magnificent.\n\n-Churros\nNothing beats a fresh, still-warm churro, with its crisp outer shell exploding with cinnamon sugar and soft, chewy inside that helps balance the cinnamon sugar sweetness with a light saltiness.

They called and called them and that person wouldnt answer or return my clothes. They probably kept it since so much brand name in it yet not good enough for Plato to buy.

I am new to Arizona from Michigan and on my own, I found this place on the Web and decided to go with it.  My cat is all I have, and I care about him very much, and I am very angry with the lack of care this Clinic has for animals.\n\nI took Bean into the clinic late January of this year to get a grooming.  My bill was over $300 for a haircut with sedation.  They offered me no \"new client\" special or anything.  They even quoted me a rate over the phone that was completely different than what they charged me.  I understand as a new client, certain vaccinations were required.  But telling me a checkup would be free and then charging me for it is NOT OK.  Moving on..\n\nNow, his lion cut, which was essential for matting prevention (typical on a Himalayan), isn't a hard cut AT ALL to do, but was UNEVEN, and whoever did the grooming totally lacked attention to detail.  If I am going to pay that much for a grooming, at LEAST pay attention to my instruction (I had even wrote down how I wanted the cut), and he had chunks missing.  Clipper ridges, and spots that were completely neglected.  No, my cat was not pretty.  I literally had to go home with the scissors and FIX his haircut myself.  \nIf a cat is SEDATED, you can take your time.  THAT IS WHY I TOOK THE DAY OFF WORK.  That is why this clinic told me they would need all day with him!\n\nWorst of all....  I took the entire day off work (this translates to losing a day of pay) so I could be available to pick him up when they were done with him, which they said \"sometime in the late afternoon early evening\".  So I waited around Scottsdale/Tempe area.  I live all the way in Desert Ridge.  But they didn't even CALL me to tell me he was finished, as promised!  \n\nI dropped him off at 9am, and the day rolled by and it was going on 5:30pm..  finally I called THEM and they told me, apathetically, \"yeah, he's ready\", as if they were annoyed I was calling (The receptionist - I should have got her name - all I remember was she was a little heavyset and blonde and around my age - but I was too furious, and she didn't even bother to notice, nor care when I said I wasn't happy with the service, she acted as if she didn't even hear me).  Every question I had for her she interrupted me.\n\nI go to collect him, and out of ALL THE EMPTY CAGES AVAILABLE in the back..  (they didn't bring him out to me, they said he was hissing and needed ME to go get him), they put him in the one above an EXTREMELY HYPER Pit Bull.  I looked at all the other empty cages.  Are you kidding me?  I was furious.  OF COURSE he is going to be terrified, coming off sedation and right on top of a loud dog with its tail wagging and barking like crazy..  I don't care if it was due to how late I was showing up - that was completely the clinic's fault.  Who would do that to a cat coming off sedation anyway?  Complete ignorance.\n\nI am spreading the word about this Clinic.  Everywhere I can.\n\nGet some volunteers that have some animal knowledge, and also a desk clerk who actually looks customers in the eye instead of filing her nails.  Then she could see the tears welling up in my eye as I signed the credit card clip holding my shaking cat.  Not only was I robbed of my time, my money, my poor cat was traumatized beyond belief.  \n\nThese people are a NO GO.  Do not take your animal here.\n\n[Now, Ashley, I have read your condescending remarks back to people who have a hard time with your Clinic.  I work in the airline industry you can guarantee I am spreading the word around about your clinic.  My job is LITERALLY to calm people who have anxiety flying in an airplane.  People of all ages from all over the world.  And your clinic can't even get it right with animals?  UNACCEPTABLE.\nMy company is responsible for a large percentage of new residents who are looking for vets, dentists, schools, etc.  YOU NAME IT - anything that comes with relocation.  I refuse to keep silent about the mistreatment I received any longer.  \n\nCustomer SERVICE and Customer CARE.  You're doing it wrong.  Your long list of people who have attested to your \"good services\" because you keep your lobby clean does NOT make up for the experience I had - again, it all boils down to ignorance.  \nA company that CARES WHOLEHEARTEDLY about their customers - (especially those who have no voice - ANIMALS) - MAKE IT RIGHT.  It's just that simple.  \nLearn how to really SERVE a customer - And your customers absolutely must be taken care of, they are typically worried and/or hurting over their animal - THEIR FAMILY MEMBER - Once you get the heart right, you will go very far.  \n\nYour success will lie in your heart, not your pocketbook.\n\nPlease note:  You do not ask for \"a second opportunity to gain their trust back\" when you lost it.

I don't suffer from any pain luckily, the main reason I was drawn to the idea of floating is the detox benefits and the intense relaxation it provides. I am always so stressed out! To be able to go into the float tank, pull the lid down, and float in complete darkness was totally euphoric to me. My body relaxed almost instantly. The soft music that plays at the beginning and end of your session really sent me into a lovely, dreamy coma. To be honest, I was a little disappointed when my session was over. I know a few people have mentioned that they get bored after laying there for an hour.. but I was enjoying it so much that the time flew by for me!\n\nI was a little afraid at first of feeling claustrophobic inside the tank. However, once I got in, I didn't feel that way at all. The tank is quite large, and knowing I could easily open and close the lid was comforting to me. I spent half of my float with the lights off, and then half with them on. I enjoyed watching the gradual shift of colors as the music was playing, it was beautiful.\n\nThe only difficulty I had was trying to keep my mind still and focused on my breathing. I kept thinking about things I had to do later on that day, if I had remembered to feed the dog on my way out, etc. As I was leaving, I explained this to Danny, the sweet and informative counter guy at True REST, and he suggested that when this happens, let the thought in your mind run its course, and then let go of it.  \n\nWhen my session was over, I felt extremely relaxed, almost in a daze. Sitting down and enjoying a cup of tea in the waiting area allowed me to gather myself together so I could drive home safely.  ;)\nI ended up signing up for a membership because I most definitely want to float again. To get all the benefits, you must do it regularly.  \n\nI've been telling all my friends about True REST! I think it's an amazing practice that needs more recognition.

We got stuck behind hundreds of people funneling into a corridor that carried people both to Canadian customs and connecting flights. We stood in that crowd until some figured out that 90% of the people were waiting to enter Canada and people with US connections could fight their way through to a line with no one in it. UNTIL that came to a screeching halt down stairs where they were filtering people through customs and security to get US connections. The we waited in a line of 50-70 people with one - count it - one security lane open. A good 30 of those people - including us had a half hour or less to make connecting flights. Evidently some of the airlines held flights to let passengers pass security. We got through just in time to have made it to the gate only to find they had taken us off the flight because we were too late getting through. next nightmare was trying to locate our luggage to get it out of the airport in order to get a hotel for the night.

I should have kept walking.\n\nI ordered the Orange Crush Hake and Chips from the counter, since it wasn't immediately apparent if it was a place with table service, but when the order was put in for takeout, I quickly asked if I could eat there instead.  The cashier (and server as I soon found out) was  obliging and quickly told the cooks that it was eat-in.  The whole transaction was in French (which can often make a difference in Montreal).\n\nThe service was remarkably fast in getting the food to the table, but after that, the experience went downhill.  Although it looked great to start with, the food was incredibly bland, no matter how much lemon and tartar sauce I used.  I was okay that the server ignored me the whole time I was there (the \"extra mile\" would have been to offer water and check in).  With eating out in restaurants much more frequently, I'm inclined to tip generously for good service (because the difference has become much more apparent), but I'll only do that on the way out when I've judged the service.  I don't feel like anyone really did a good job, and when they all ignored me on the way out, suddenly I wasn't inclined to part with any more money.  (I totally had it ready in my pocket for the tip basket too.)\n\nWhen I left, I felt a funny feeling in my throat (definitely from the food), but today it's actually a full-blown sore throat.\n\nI usually give glowing reviews but this restaurant needs the feedback.  I think people will be more forgiving of bad food if the service is great, but usually those go hand in hand, so maybe the staff have given up.

And by campers, I mean we have an awesome pull behind 34 ft trailer that suit us all just fine.  Some would call it \"glamping\" but whatever.  We have never stayed at a KOA, but we're optimistic, paid the $30 to become members, and started a new relationship.  I had to go to a week long class in Charlotte, and needed to stay somewhere that wasn't $100+ a night, since I was footing the bill for this trip.  We were able to get a site here on the fly- which was good!!  The lady on the phone was very nice and pleasant.\nThe campground itself was a little odd.  The sites were sort of funny- in the middle- they were all stacked up on top of each other.  They did upgrade us to a concrete pad- which was nice, but like the other folks that reviewed stated- there isn't much room for vehicles, and there was no fire rings- weird.\nYou DO have to check in at the gas station across the little road (that is attached to a bar- that stays pretty busy for a gas station bar, and a liquor store), but the Publix (best grocery store in the world!) across the way was exciting.\nI thought it was very nice and helpful that the KOA guy that checked us in, got into his KOA little jeep thing and showed us the way to our site.  ITs a good thing he did, b/c my husband almost clipped a tree not paying attention to the back of the camper.\nSince I was there a whole week, i got to see how most folks that stay there only stay for a night or two.  At least on the side WE were staying.  On the other side of the fence, it looks like people are LIVING there.  Full time living there. Is that a thing? Can people do that?\nThere is a $30 rental fee (refundable) to hook up to the cable.\nThere is also wifi (the reason for the 2 star review).  The wifi shows a full signal, but it's terrible!  Poor me- no wifi while I'm camping- but the problem is I was there for a CLASS and had to do tests and studying for several hours a night.  On the first day when I couldn't get online with their \"free wifi\", I had to up the data for my cell phone and just use it as a hot spot.  Went through about 3 gigs the whole week.  If you're using the free wifi as a selling point- please make sure it works!\n\nWe will give KOA another shot- but probably not this one.  The traffic in this area is out of control.  Like INSANE.  The traffic was so bad, i didn't even venture to any restaurants in the area, b/c I was afraid that I couldn't make it back across the street with all 4 lanes blocked all morning and all evening.

Food came out quick and we were able to pay and leave very quickly at the end of our meal. Drink refills never really happened, and I have only went on nights that were not particularly busy. \n\nWhen it comes to food, I feel the restaurant doesn't live up to the hype. Let me start off by saying that The Mission does offer many unique dishes, such as a duck confeit. I commend them for that. However, when it comes to taste, it's not anything special. There are too many other great local competitors that specialize in Mexican cuisine, especially in the Old Town area.\n\nFor example, what is supposed to be a spicy guacamole is actually quite bland. Most proteins are excessively salted. With portion sizes being somewhat on the smaller side, I had high expectations for the taste and texture of food, but there really was nothing to set The Mission above other options. \n\nWorth a try just to say you have eaten here. Otherwise, I would rather just go to Bandera down the street. They have excellent Southwestern food (the ribs are particularly exceptional).

I believe in second chances but even after their THIRD chance.... joke is truly on us. Refurnished our house with a new baby on the way and all this place has been is added and unnecessary trouble. \nEverything started out fine. We got a washer and dryer from here about two years ago... NO issues.\nCouple weeks ago... Open a credit account with them so that we can get everything we need at once to move into a new place. Ordered a new W&D and a 60 inch flat screen. I was told IN the store, \"You'll get an email two days before to confirm delivery.\" Got that email... Email says \"We will contact you by phone 40 minutes ahead of scheduled delivery.\" \nWe. Never. Got. A. Call. When my fianc\u00e9 finally did get a call, it was the delivery men stating they were \"outside\" and would only wait 5 more minutes before leaving. I was on the other side of town picking up our 7 year old son. I called the delivery man back and politely stated that we were under the impression we would have a 40 minute heads up. They, now, (Not-so-politely) said they could wait \"15 minutes\". (I needed 30 to get home.)\nI immediately called HHGREGG customer service and filed a complaint. The lady I spoke with was nice. Said she would call their supervisor and figure it out. After about 7-8 minutes on hold, she assured me that they would be there within 15 minutes of my arrival home.\nI get home and 10 minutes later the delivery men show back up. I walk outside, (keep in mind - 8 months pregnant and with my 7 year old) to two men smoking cigarettes as they greet me, almost undressing me with their eyes. (They are very lucky my fianc\u00e9 wasn't there for that.)\nThey take about 15 minutes to get the washer and dryer upstairs, knocking it all over freshly painted walls. (I'm sure it's not an easy job to move that heavy stuff, but it's your JOB. Please try a little harder.)\nTHEN - they try to get me to sign for the washer and dryer. Ask them where our TV was... said \"We don't know anything about a TV.\" I asked to see their delivery instructions and sure enough... the TV was on there. They pulled the TV off the truck and stuck the box in the middle of my living room floor. (I was under the impression they would get it out and set it up - but I guess not.)\nSigned for it and they left. Was told \"We need 5s on our survey, please.\" Awesome. I'll do you a favor and just NOT take it because there's not a score low enough for the service we received.\nTo top it off.... We went BACK and ordered a new couch. Set up delivery for a time that we would be home. They brought HALF of our couch. Said they \"forgot the other pieces\". I'm sorry.... WHAT? How do you forget the product you're delivering? So we had to make sure someone was there AGAIN today for the rest of our couch to be delivered by more unprofessional and seemingly improperly trained young men.\nWhen we pay these items off, TRUST ME, when I say we are cancelling the store credit card.

First time I went I made the appointment I told them that my hair was dyed a medium chocolate brown and I wanted some caramel highlights. I knew that having dye in my hair would not make the highlights exactly caramel, so my expectations were rational.\nThe instructor was present for the first five minutes then disappeared, until the student started to panic a bit and he showed up to shrug his shoulders a little then walked off.  In the end I was left with three toned hair, NO highlights, and my hair was fried.  I've had highlights done before (under similar hair circumstances) and this has not happened.  I however didn't know that they had ruined my hair until I got home and realized what had happened (better light).  I called them the next day to ask about what they could do for me, and all they could offer me was to come back in the next 7 days to have the colour corrected.  Which was unacceptable because I had to work and could not be in their salon in time, and besides my hair was already over processed to be dyed again.  The woman on the phone was not empathetic with me at all, and did not see the fact that not only was I out $100, I was also now an extra $60 in the hole because I had bought some hair masks to treat my over processed hair.  They were rude and  were not going to try and rectify the issue with me at all.\n\nThe second time was last September.  My friend was getting married and being the person that I am I gave Aveda Academy another chance.  I made the appointment almost three months in advance for a simple cut and style (no colour, I learned my lesson).  The week of the wedding my Nana died so now I was going to a Funeral and a Wedding all in one weekend.  That Saturday as I walked to my appointment (early in the morning) I got a call from them telling me that my hair dresser had been in a minor accident, and that my appointment had been canceled.  I asked them if they had anyone to just trim my hair and give it a quick blow dry.  I expressed my sincere concern about the injured stylist, but then explained my problem of having the Wedding and Funeral.  After all this I received ZERO empathy and not even an iota of effort to try and help me.  \nSo I was left wandering around the city trying to find a stylist, with a Wedding that afternoon and my Nana's Funeral the next day.  \n\nI think that it's a 50/50 thing there.

However the truly scary thing is I can't tell if it was on purpose or by accident. \n\nI am a new mother who rarely gets time now for things like haircuts and so I was pleased when I was able to snag a baby sitter and sneak away for a little me time.

The salon is small which I don't mind, but the decor looks like it's stuck in the 90's.  My stylist was nice, but I soon realized she was very chatty and that is coming from a stay at home mom who is usually desperate to talk to people.  I asked for a trim to get rid of damage and I was aware that this meant an inch would be coming off.  I remember asking her to just reshape what I already had which I can assure you was not a bob-mullet!  I have curly hair and the cut I had before was perfect because it was long layers which add some volume but the weight helps minimize frizz.

It has shade, a splash pad and lots of space. It can get pretty messy at times especially on the weekend. We love the design of this area. Playground in the middle of the park is very close to the geese and ducks and there is a lot of poop around the play structure, no shade, and is quite small. Bright purple playground is okay, no shade looks like it's for small parties with kids. Last playground has a lot of uneven surfaces, some shade but also close to ducks & geese and it's definitely out of its prime.\n\nSports:\nBasketball courts are okay, but get pretty crowded on weekends and after 4ish. \nBall fields are very nice and easy to play at except baseball season. There are fields in the middle of the park and a few on the Warm Springs end\nHaven't tried the frisbee golfing, Volleyball.\nFishing/RC boat racing is fun to watch, but the pond is not somewhere I would recommend to be around. It's very filthy and sometimes has a foul smell. \n\nDog Parks:\n3 parks that rotate sizes large & small and one is closed for maintenance or upkeep. What to say...the park is usually maintained well, but owners are often oblivious and do not clean after their dogs. I have been bit twice by the same dog on the small dog side. The owner is a regular and you don't want to bring a vulnerable puppy around for sure. This park has good days and bad but it's usually the owners that make it unwelcoming. My dogs are extremely hyper and have short noses that make them sound \"aggressive\" during play because their breathing. I understand to humans, humping is probably obscene but dogs do this and will usually HIT my dog or KICK him off if he tries to hump. I find it irritating that owners here expect dogs to act just like them. Initiating real play is a challenge, so I like to come in the late night or early morning to avoid crowds of people.

I have had my Ford Mustang V6 since 2006 (2006 model). Every month it was something new that was wrong with it.. mechanical and electronically. So this Monday my car was back at the service department for a fuel pump sensor. They called and quoted me over $500 for a $30 part. No thanks, so i paid the $120 for them to go throughout my car to see if anything else was wrong with it. Final report: new brake pads =$400, fine. NOTHING else was said on the paper work, NOTHING.\n\nFlash forward two days, 10 pm at night driving 70 mph in the fast lane on the 95. My right front tire sounds like is about to fall off.. so i pull off the freeway (going 10 mph) to see if i had a flat. My boyfriends father comes to my rescue since he used to work at the speedway. My tire had RIPPED IN HALF!!! The metal braiding inside of it was wrapped around my rim. Come to find out ALL 4 of my tires were COMPLETELY bald! $600 later for new tires...\n\nMy question is: HOW COULD THEY NOT HAVE TOLD ME???? I paid them $120 for what! And on top of that i could have been killed if i did not stop right away when i heard the noise (quoting the tow driver). I would never ever let this company touch a car again! The next day i finally got rid of my mustang, such a beautiful car but not worth the money or my life. I got a 2012 new honda because at lease i know that i have a dependable, safe car now.

It's like they are on purpose trying to offset your blissful beer savouring session. It can be anything: a waiter who got up on the wrong side of the bed,  often non functioning urinals (I do hope the sign I saw the last time on the ladies' washroom saying \"Temporarily unisex. Sorry for the inconvenience\" was a joke by some prankster) and occasionally smelly washrooms, chronic shortage of menus, low stiff benches and high tables that never allow you lean back and relax properly, etc. And accepting only Visa or cash? I mean c'mon!

I know there's general scarcity of decent BBQ places around Toronto, but seriously this is nowhere near the level all the reviews will lead you to believe.\n\nMy personal experience consisted of a pulled pork sandwich and a pancetta wrapped smoked trout (with fries on the side for good measure). First the pulled pork. The meat itself was nothing special, a little bit on the dryer side, lacking tenderness and could definitely use some more smoking time. And no, I could not detect any of the apple/hickory flavours (and none of my friends could either). The sauce was quite a disappointment too. A character lacking thin sour-sweet mixture. You want to feel the difference try some of the sauces from our neighbours south of the border, or even go to one of the local rib fests and you're bound to encounter way better options. The trout sandwich on the other hand could have been a nice idea, had it not been for a crazy amount of salt they put into it (and into everything else for that matter). Is that salt on my fries or fries on salt? Keep going to this place on a regular basis and pretty soon you'll be feeling dryer than King Tut on his 20th birthday.

I don't remember where I read it before, but somebody said that it was one of the best mackerel he/she ever tried. So I decided to check it for myself. And oh boy did it blew me away! It's unlike any mackerel I've ever tried before. The easiest way to describe it is what a friend of mine did, by comparing it to pickled herring. Only it was like 50 times better! In fact we were so impressed that I decided to ask the owner what the secret was and (surprisingly) he went so far as to tell us all the details. I don't know if I should reveal all of their secrets, but basically they soak the mackerel in a certain Chilean semi-dry wine (btw it's a 30$ bottle in an LCBO store), let it sit there for a couple of days and then slice and serve it. Definitely a star of the show and a must have if you ask me.\n\nPricewise it's not the cheapest place out there, but honestly for what you get at this place, it's worth every penny.

Luckily my worries were allayed by a very pleasant young gentleman who attended to our table and was very helpful with the choice of food and wine. Since we went for the stone cooked food experience I can't comment on other dishes, but the two orders of  stoned meat and fish arrived in a very timely fashion and when we asked for an additional stone to replace the one that was getting cold, we got right away.\n\nAs far as the stoned fish and meat go, they are what you'd expect: no seasoning except for salt. So you will definitely experience the full flavour of whatever you're having (we decided to go the whole hog and tried kangaroo, venison, wild boar, tiger shrimps, sea scallops, salmon and tuna; my personal favourites were tuna and venison, and I'm still wondering what part of kangaroo looks very much like a sausage). The potions were quite generous and we couldn't even finish what we'd ordered.\n\nIf I had to criticize, there're two things I'd like to point out. First of all, the place has no cooking hoods over the tables, so the odour of whatever you're cooking (especially meat) will linger for some time and will make you smell like a boar too. This is somewhat alleviated by the size of the place, but is still an oversight in my opinion. Secondly, while the stones are more than adequate to cook sea food and vegetables, they are not nearly big enough to cook any decently sized steak. They just don't retain enough heat and even if you use a succession of 10 stones all you'll end up with is a shoe sole like crust on the outside and an absolutely raw meat on the inside. So you have to cut the meat into smaller pieces, which does make it less juicy.\n\nOverall I liked the place  (very nice service, great atmosphere  and unique experience), though they definitely could've put more thought into the details.

The server was very courteous and attentive. The menu was not overwhelming (a dozen dishes or so), very well thought out and I believe everybody should be able find something to his/her liking. Everything about this place says high class: pre-warmed plates, everybody's food is served at the same time, old fashioned waiters with bowties... Well, you've gotten the idea.\n\nWe were served some freshly made bread with butter to tide us over while waiting for  the main course. I ordered the halibut (which was the fish of the day) with green leek mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables on the side. Everything was done to perfection and just melted in my mouth. My friends had scallops and cod fish and were equally impressed. Be warned that every dish is very rich. But hey, as they say in my home country \"you can't spoil porridge with butter\", and I stand 100% behind this adage. Oh yeah, even though they didn't make it, but the chilled Riesling wine was a perfect compliment to the fish.\n\nThings you might want to consider:\n- Ask to be seated on the second floor if possible, since the first one smells a bit like kitchen (this is understandable considering how small the place is).\n- They have a set menu which actually is pretty good and has at least a third of the options from the regular menu.

We both prefer the arugula salad due to the delicious vinegarette and plentiful toppings.  \n\nWe also share the pesto potatoes which was the highlight of the food.  Yummy tender fingerlings with warm Brie & nutty pesto.\n\nWith dinner, my friend goes for a blueberry hill again and I try the acai tequila \"world\" drink which is my ultimate tangy margarita I've been searching for.  Delicious & refreshing.\n\nFor dessert we opt for the chocolate bundito which is a graham cracker cookie served alongside a little jar of chocolate goodness with homemade banana marshmallow.  This dessert has amazing gooey texture that you must feverishly lick your spoon to get every last drop.  We mentioned how we loved the cookies & our sweetheart sever says \"well next time well bring extra\".  \n\nSpeaking of service- the people here obviously take pride in their cuisine and love to create a great dining experience.

I was very pleased to hear that they knew how to cook a steak \"Pittsburgh rare\".\nMy husband and I ordered the exact same thing: sirloin cut with potatoes and caesar salads. The salad had a bit too much dressing, but that's fine. I'm not there for the vegetables.\nOur steaks arrived in a timely fashion and were absolutely PERFECT! My husband and I were very happy with our meals and overall experience.\nThe service and timing of everything was great, and the manager even stopped by to make sure all was well. \nMy only reason for giving 4 stars is because I had to ask for the bread and butter, when I was under the impression that it's supposed to arrive with the drinks or salads.

Pretty nice course for the middle of summer. It was in excellent condition. Greens, fairways, rough, everything was immaculate. I'm a 4 handicap, and the tips provide a nice challenge, especially when you're hitting long irons into a majority of the par 4s, as well as hitting a 3-wood into a par 3. The signature 16th with it's island green is stunning. The hardest part about this course are the greens. Trees don't really prove a challenge since most are palms, and relatively easy to negotiate, but the greens are extremely difficult. Most have several tiers that place a premium on location.\nThe only negatives are that they don't have a long range, only 100 yards or so, so it makes it difficult to judge your distances when warming up. And the planes overhead don't help either. Planes are arriving in the early afternoon, so it's not terrible, but when they change the active runway later in the afternoon, it sends the planes departing right over the course; and departing planes make much more noise than arriving planes.\nBut, all in all, a great course.

Everyone greets you.  That's great. \n\nThe rooms are wonderful.  Our room was like a one bedroom apartment with a dining area and full kitchen.

There is a bedroom separate from the living area. The bed was comfortable.  There are 2 tv's, so no sharing. The pull out couch is an awesome asset. Lastly the room is well lit.   \n\nThe pool area is amazing.  Amazing!   Unlike some other hotels you can actually swim in this pool. It's large enough. There are 2 sides.  One larger size with the water fall which you can swim under. This pool also has the restaurant right next to the pool.  The other side has 4 water slides. 2 smaller ones and 2 larger ones. Plus another small swim area. There are 5 hot tubs located throughout.  There are many places to sit,  chill or eat plus hammocks.  Lots of shade. There is a huge bbq area near the pool with dining table near by. \n\nOther great amenities. ..an activity room with billiards,  24 hour business center,  plenty of luggage trollies, very clean resort and good security. \n\nNegatives. There are not a lot. When dialing 0 for service,  long wait.  At one point no answer.   It seemed to take awhile to get something delivered like towels.

The cards are not guest specific so there really isn't any control.   \n\n If the resort reads these reviews,  there are a few suggestions.   We ate our pizza on our balcony to enjoy the evening. It would be nice to have an outdoor dining set out there rather than just the 2 chairs and small side table.   There is enough room for a table and 4 chairs.\n\nAgain, not a lot of negatives.

That must be because they keep the ice machine behind the fish tanks. No fish tanks at PING PANG PONG hahahaha.)\n\n Bring someone Chinese with you if you are scared.

That is not always the case in Las Vegas so it is a nice plus. The line at check-in moved fairly well and the process moved at a decent pace too.\n\nThere are plenty of elevators which helps. The appearance once you are off the elevator is lacking though. It feels like you are in a parking garage.

I do appreciate there is no carpet, as the general lack of cleanliness in other areas would lead me to believe carpet would have been filthy. There is a good amount of space and a lot of windows. We had a decent view of the High Roller. One of the lamps was not working and the outlets were not conveniently located.\n\nThe bathroom was a different story. It looks as though it has not been updated since the casino was built. On top of that it looked and felt a little dirty. Everything was in working order at least.\n\nWe did not eat at any of the restaurants, so I cannot speak to them. That being said, none of them sounded like anything we wanted to try either.

I had last minute visitors on New Years Eve and didn't have anything to prepare before they arrived. They had just dropped a menu by a few days before and I had been meaning to try them plus I saw they had a Groupon. I called at 4pm for pickup at 6pm. They were totally able to accomodate that. The menu offers a good variety of calzones but doesn't give descriptions so I asked for recommendations from the staff member taking my order.  She was so friendly and accomodating which is so refreshing after having dealt with the non caring attitudes experienced at so many other places. I ordered the steak, buffalo chicken, pesto chicken and a classic pepperoni.  I also ordered a green salad and a seasonal apple salad.  I arrived to pick my order at 6:15. Greeted by friendly face at counter, I believe she was also the young lady who I'd placed the order with two hours earlier.  I was the only customer there the entire visit, it was strange.  Super clean and bright interior with super cute butcher paper rolls hanging from the ceiling to the floor with the menu whimsically scrolled.  I presented my Groupon and paid it was more than I expected after Groupon deducted but Groupon description was kinda weird too soo...I didn't really know what it should have been.  I'm waiting for the order to get packed up for me I notice the giant house made cookies in giant jars on the counter.  I was just about to order all 4 kinds when a young man came out and said they were giving free cannollis for New Years.  So I ordered just 2 so as not overdue it.  Took about 5 minutes to get it all together.  They labeled the calzones and provided a variety of dipping sauces to try.  \n\nOnce I got them home I cut them into smaller finger food sized portions so the four of us could sample every kind.  The salads were made with really fresh romaine and leafy greens.  The seasonal salad had chicken on it, which I didn't order, but it was delicious with vinegrette that was recommended, pear or something.  The green salad had kalamata olives and veggies and was so good with the balsamic vinegrette. The chicken on the salad seemed like a precooked variety, not totally sure, it was tasty though.  All of the calzones were awesome as well as the dipping sauces which tasted like from scratch, I'm guessing they are.  The four of us couldn't finish it all but each made sure to same room for sweets.  Those complimentary cannollis, some of the best I've had, mini and so good.  The cookies, amazing.  So glad I finally tried Presto.  \n\nCouple of suggestions for the owners.  Your menu could be improved by just including a bit more description for calzones.  I'm always comfortable asking servers for recommendations and descriptions and your staff did a great job but I could see other potential customers struggling with this. Also, when I ordered the salads I was asked what kind of dressing I wanted and for calzones what kind of dipping sauce.  They are not shown on your menu so again I had to ask for descriptions.  Just make it easy for people.  That seasonal salad was perfect with the dressing recommended but might not as been as spectacular with another.  Sell your food with the those items that highlight and elevate the flavors.  Don't give people too much freedom to change the product you envisioned. Substitute when requested like I did, pecans for walnuts, but otherwise sell what you know we will love!\n\nHighly recommended!

What? Seriously? There's like, a huge gym across the street, really!? Well yadda yadda, fast forward a few months after Planet Fitness opened, I got over it and joined the gym because it was insanely cheap and a great deal for me and my husband ($21 a month).\n\nEverything sounds lovely right? Eh, wrong. Here's the short break down of the two star rating: 1. price (cheap) 2. still fairly new and not yet rundown.\n\nI must say that the one thing that ruins an experience for me is attitude/poor service. It's the biggest pet peeve of mine to be treated as though I'm annoying someone simply by walking through a door of a public business. Yes, I sincerely apologize for giving your job, who pays you an hourly wage, money so that they can keep paying you. \n\nThe front desk has declined in overall professionalism and friendliness over the years. Sorry to go here but when did they start hiring hood rats? Tonight, my husband, brother in law and I walk in about 30 minutes before closing for a quick workout. My husband says hi and gives the girl working the counter my member number and says that he's also signing in as my guest. The girl snaps, \"You know we close in 30 minutes, right?\" Wow. And no, Miss Angry Woman, we were all unaware of the closing time that's posted on the front door that you can't miss each time you walk in. We say that we're aware of the closing time, this person snaps again with, \"This is account is under [my full name].\" Wow again. She had to be some sort of special to disregard what my husband had just stated when we walked in (my member ID and that he was my guest). Maybe if she wasn't actively being a witch with a B, she would have heard him the first time.\n\nAt this point, I walked away to the locker rooms because I couldn't take anymore rudeness and didn't want to reciprocate the treatment.\n\nLook, I understand having a bad day at work or maybe being a bit peeved if a customer walks in minutes before closing, BUT YOU DON'T SHOW IT. If I'm paying for a service I expect you to be, at the very least, cordial.\n\nWhen our contract ends, we may just go back across the street to their competitor. Sure, they cost a bit more but the saying is very true - you get what you pay for. We were also never treated with attitude but always greeted with a friendly hello, and the sign in process was painless, unlike Planet Fatness.\n\nOh and the TVs were off. They close at 9, not 8:35.

Might be a bit loud for those looking to bring a date, but otherwise a good option if you're in the area: you'll enjoy the meal and it has a friendly atmosphere. Lots of competition with moxies, jack astors and others in the immediate area as well.\n\nReason for 3 stars: The apps and entrees were ok, while the dessert was great. \n\nWould I go back? Yes - but mainly for dessert.\n \nLoong review:  \n\nGood looking staff + modern decor + decent food seems to be the recipe for success these days, and earls has seen plenty of it over the past few years.  The ever expanding franchise opened up a new location in Woodbridge this past week, right next to the Colossus movie theater, and it follows the same tried and true recipe, although it executes on some parts better than others.\n\nFood at these neo-American restaurants is typically isn't the strong point, good enough so people enjoy the meal, but you're coming for the drinks, atmosphere and service.  Call me Picky, but I've rarely had a meal that blows me away at one of these places, except for Joeys @ Don Mills. Earls pretty much falls into the same category as these places, with medicore food, though not spectacular, save the desserts which are frickin good, especially the smores. While the starters & entrees are good, the dessert is the strong point here, so definitely save room.  I came here with a few friends and we shared multiple things. Full rundown at the end of the review.\n\nAs most folks head to earls for the atmosphere, I'll mention it here as well. There's a nice entrance with a stone exterior and an outdoor fireplace, 'cause, we all know how cold it gets in the winter, right? Indoors, it's dimly lit and there's little separation between the bar and restaurant areas, so it may be a bit noisy for some seeking a quieter dinner (i.e. on a date).  The decor is similarly dark and I'd say on the verge of old fashioned or boring. Those chandeliers they have in the restaurant section have got to go though, it's a round piece of wood with lights circling the thing, I wouldn't be surprised it they came straight from Medieval Times.\n\nThere was nothing medieval, rough, or boring about the service though. The staff, manager and hostess' were all very kind, friendly, inviting and made you feel comfortable. \n\nStarters:\nCeasar salad - pass on it. boring.\nSpinach dip - delicious. comes with deep fried bread and the dip is very good. Eat it quick, once that dip goes cold it's not nearly as good.\n\nEntrees:\nSalmon - well cooked, well seasoned and a healthy portion, it was an enjoyable dish. Fairly standard, though anyone ordering this isn't looking for a \"wow\" dish\nSteak w/ some mushroom sauce - well cooked, thick cut though small portion (looked like a filet, but not sure it was), it was a fairly average steak at a restaurant. You won't go wrong with it, it's a safe pick\nSteak (sauceless) - Dry for my liking, wasn't juicy enough for me to order it again. I'd go for the sauced version.\nPizzas - the pizzas are ok, thin crust and not overpowering with any one ingredient. Another safe order\nSalad with prawns - this was really good. I enjoy sweeter salads, and this was one of them, coming with a mix of berries, nuts cheese and lightly glazed with a sweet dressing.  A healthy portion of shrimps was given in the salad as well. \nChicken club sandwich - typical chicken club, meh\nPasta -  I tried two pastas, both were mediocre. One with a tomato sauce was a bit sour, and the other with an alfredo sauce was a bit bland and the pasta undercooked.  I'd shy away from the pasta, but I'm not a big pasta fan anyhow. \nChicken Curry w/ Nann and Rice - I'm always surprised that there's Indian dishes at these places, but I guess that attests to Toronto's multi-culturism. Anyhow, the curry was alright, not overly spiced, the rice had been buttered up so it was good, and the nann was fresh, though didn't have those burnt edges/seared surface that I love. \n\nDesserts:\nSundae in caramel toffee bowl - the bowl itself is made from some caramel/toffee mixture I think, so it's edible, and delicious. It's what sets the dish apart from other places. There aren't many toppings on it though, I wish it did.\nChocolate toffee cake - it's delicious, sweet, warm, rich, it's great.\nCheesecake - my friends liked this more than I did. It's a good portion and not very sweet. I'm a fan of sweet and creamy cheesecakes (i.e. Cheesecake factory) and this was the less creamy, less sweet kind. \nSmores - I'm saving the best for last because this was AWESOME. Homemade marshmallows, homemade graham crackers with a gingery tint to it (if you like Starbuck's ginger molasses cookie,you'll LOVE this) and melted chocolate. Comes with two smores... mmmmmmmmmmm... so much better than making them around a camp fire.

Get takeout!\n\nThe full review:\n\nDefinitely not for the healthy eaters out there (hey, it' sa LARDery) but I recommend you check out this little (I mean, little) on your cheat days. They have some of the best fries I've had in Toronto, thin, fresh and crispy, and the friend chicken is cooked well.  It's not for those that love batter (it's rather light on batter) but the meat is juicy - even the white meat! \n\nI've had better pulled pork, so I would pass on that. Next time I'd try their beef brisket (looked great) and ribs (also looked good).  \n\nIt's a shame they got rid of their fish tacos though (it's still on the website, but they don't serve it anymore), I heard those were awesome.\n\nBut I warn you, plan ahead and get take out, and just eat somewhere else. My friends waited about 40 minutes to get a seat (I showed up casually late so didn't wait long)!\n\nOnly reason I deduct a star is because I've had better pulled pork, and the wait time is horrid.", "business_id": "k6zmSLmYAquCpJGKNnTgSQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-17", "useful": 1, "cool": 1}, {"funny": 2, "user_id": "XuCbLgo9j1q5dDh9251vkg", "review_id": "I6FUil5zlGhEVe1qEO9jkg", "text": "Get the: coconut flavored wings!\n\nPrice: $11 per lb of wings (7-8 wings), half price on Wed and Sunday.\n\nOverall: The wings were OK, large and juicy, but most of the flavors didn't come through.\n\nI never would have found this place had a friend not recommended it to me on a Sunday for half price wings. While on Unionville Main Street, it's a bit hidden as it's away from the busy sections of the street and there isn't much visible signage from the street. \n\nAnyway, walking in I was pleasantly surprised. Like the rest of Main Street, it has the old wooden decor and has a comfortable atmosphere for a resto-bar establishment. They have several TVs which were playing the football games but it was more of a restaurant atmosphere than a sports bar.\n\nThe wings menu was pretty interesting. It was different than the rest of those 1,000,000 flavors places. With approx 30 different flavors, it was still an extensive menu but the some flavors seemed pretty unique. They had tandoori flavored wings, a sweet coconut flavor, molasses with horseradish, peri-peri, and even apple cinnamon!\n\nWhile the menu caught my eye, the wings themselves were just ok. I had a bunch of guys with me so we tried about 12 of the flavors they had to offer.  None of them were very spicy, so if you like spicy wings don't expect to be wowed by the heat meter here.  The flavor on some of the wings was also too subtle. I was really excited for the apples and cinnamon flavor, which smelled a heck of a lot like apple pie when it arrived but failed to connect with my taste buds. Another one which was advertised as molasses with horseradish also didn't have much horseradish, so it was pretty much just a sweet wing (like a honey garlic flavor). The wings themselves were large and juicy though, so thumbs up there.\n\nThe coconut flavored wings were by far my favorite, it was definitely unique and I'd go back for those. My runner up would be one from the Baked Wings list, I forgot the name but it was smokey and packed good flavor. \n\nAll in all, it's a nice atmosphere, big and juicy wings (though I wish the flavors would come out more), and average prices.

I randomly  passed by Nova, saw their sign, and decided to stop in to see what they had.  I already had a chocolate croissant and doughnut in hand from Truscott Bakery, but too much butter is never a bad thing (right?).\n\nI'm going to preface my review by saying that I had a good experience, but I've only tried ONE thing here: the apple turnover. Everything did look good though. Since I've only tried one thing, and had a monster pastry craving at the time, I'm going to give it 3 stars for now (it's probably 3 and a half) and I'll update when I make another trip. Hey, what can I say, I'm like the teacher you love to hate, I don't give easy marks :)\n\nFirst, it's fairly large for a bakery, they sandwiches and hot food, complete with a sit down section, a small grocery section and a good num ber of pastries and baked breads. \n\nPastries were about $1.35 for each (and most of it looked great: cinnamon twists, strudles, turnovers, pies looked awesome, eclaires and various puff pastries, tarts). Bagels were $0.50.\n\nAfter tasting their apple turnover, I'm going to go back and try some of their other offerings, because it was pretty good!  I microwaved the turnover when I got into the office (we don't have a toaster oven, unfortunately) but it was still really good, the crust was flaky and crispy and the filling with apple-y and sweet. \n\nTheir breads smelled and looked delicious so I'll have to pick up a loaf of something next time 'round.  As mentioned above, pies also look really good so I'm going to have to go carb-heavy one of these days and just try out some of their other things. It was busy (especially for 9:15 am on a Tuesday) so the turnover here must be pretty high and I assume it's fairly popular. \n\nI'll be back and I'll update my rating accordingly.", "business_id": "DSQRaYesIY5EFmCHe0LbzA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-02-22", "useful": 6, "cool": 2}, {"funny": 1, "user_id": "XuCbLgo9j1q5dDh9251vkg", "review_id": "uz4A206A-Po4ZU7tD_sG3Q", "text": "This review is for their cookies only.\nI've yet to try their bread or other pastries - but the cookies were hard and not so delicious.

Sushi on 7 (across the street) is pretty good as well, but seating is limited there so you'll have an easier time finding a table at Yang's on a weekend.\n\nWhat sets Yang's apart is that Yang's has a greater number and variety of dishes at Yang's than other AYCE sushi places, including a about 12-16 items from the grill such as salmon belly, salmon head, mackerel, sole filets and have some items such as salmon tataki, beef tataki and eel pancake that other AYCE sushi places don't have.  \n\nThe sushi is good, I've only had one or two experiences in the many times I've gone here where the sushi was still really cold.  Considering how busy they are they get food out to you quickly.  Do be warned that they seem to run out of some items later at night, this past weekend they were out of seaweed salad and steamed egg. \n\nThey have an assortment of ramen, udon and fried rices as well. \n\nDesserts are your typical AYCE fare of ice cream and fried banana (which aren't very good, but there aren't many AYCE places with good friend banana anyway). \n\nIt's about $29 (tip and tax included) for dinner on a weekend, and I think about $26 on a weekday.\n\nMy favorite AYCE sushi shop is still Prince sushi in Mississauga, but this Yang's a good choice if you're in the north east end of the GTA.", "business_id": "qGC_GE-1fnjVvfzpu_Lbkw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-28", "useful": 2, "cool": 2}, {"funny": 1, "user_id": "XuCbLgo9j1q5dDh9251vkg", "review_id": "JAbmkz509hLpn7VO2sJO3g", "text": "A small, clean Indian food joint tucked away in a little corner, Narula's serves up some good Indian cuisine for a reasonable price.

When you hear that, I know you're thinking \"this has got to be some Taco Bell, Grade F beef\"... well, that's what I thought when I drove past. But after a friend convinced me to come here, I can tell you, it's definitely not. You get a quality steak (they have a ton of choices, NY, Rib, Porterhouse, T-bone, etc.) or chicken, smoked ribs, pulled pork, or even soulvaki for a great price.\n\nI had a 12 oz Rib steak + baby back ribs with fries and a draft beer for $22 all in. Seriously. \n\nThe steak was cooked to my liking (rare) and they cooked it perfectly.  The steak doesn't have much seasoning on it, but you can add bbq sauce or pepper to it if you want.  I wouldn't say \"Keg quality\" like other posts, but the cook knows his stuff, and the meat is good.  The ribs were also pretty tasty and tender.  \n\nYou can also get a 12 oz draft beer for $2.10, I don't know how you can beat that. \n\nThey have a pretty wide array of menu items (makes me wonder how they stock/prepare all these meats, and if they have enough turnover to get through their smoked meats) and I'll definitely be back to try some other items, such as a pulled pork sandwich with fries for $6.99, Beef ribs with a side for $11, Del Monico steak (on special) with a side for $12. \n\nIf you're in the area and you have a carnivore craving and don't mind a diner type setting, I'd suggest it.\n\nUPDATE:\nI tried the Del Monaco steak + fries + onion rings. They won't let you sub fries for onion rings (you can only sub fries for salad), so I just got it as an additional side.  \n\nI don't like the cut of the Del Monaco, they charge more for it, but it's a thinner cut so I'd stick with the rib eye. The fries are good here, but I'd pass on the onion rings as well. Cheap for $2.50, but they use a thick batter so it's very doughy.
