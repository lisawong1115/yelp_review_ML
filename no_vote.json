Their specialty are mousse drinks - which we had no idea what exactly it was. So when we asked the staff, they said it was some sort of cheese. \n\nFor a Sunday afternoon, they were also out of grass jelly and pudding, which are ingredients in quite a few of their drinks (so not sure how that works).\n\nThe service is really bad, they don't understand English so when you asked them about the menu items, they can't really explain what they are.\n\nWe had ordered the following:\n- slush mango (came with tapioca and mousse)\n- peach ice tea\n- roasted oolong milk tea\n- supernova kumquat lemonade\n\nAnd when we asked what the difference between a supernova kumquat lemonade under the galaxy drinks section (which are supposed to be layered drinks), and the kumquat lemonade, they said it had a layer of blue mousse - so we were like ok we will try it then. But what came was just a bigger cup size of the kumquat lemonade. When we asked them again, they said it was just a size difference, that's what makes it supernova - which is pretty dumb to me as on the menu both items had the same two size choices of regular or large. \n\nThe mango slush and the roasted oolong milk tea wasn't bad. But the other two was not that great. The tea had a big floral taste that overpowered everything. There was no peach taste in the peach ice tea. The kumquat one had no kumquat taste and was just bitter from the lime and it tasted like it had no sugar in it at all.\n\nI guess if you need a non-busy place to use WIFI and work, then this is the place, no one wants to come here.\n\nAlso - their gimmick also seems to be the lightbulb drinks, which were intriguing to us, but you are not allowed to take the lightbulb home...\n\nWe will definitely not be returning...", "business_id": "l1_S1mfGbEMxfT1f9omhEA", "stars": 1, "date": "2017-10-16", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "u0LXt3Uea_GidxRW1xcsfg", "review_id": "EKAN4jw3LsE3631feSaA_g", "text": "My boyfriend took me here for my birthday.

Had we not ordered so many other dishes, we would have ordered a second round of this. Who knew bone marrow could be this tasty!!\n\nThen came the Spicy Horse Tartare, which we thought was intriguing, as we have never heard, so we had ordered it. When it showed up, it was like a salad. Wasn't bad, worth trying but probably only a one-time thing for us.\n\nTongue on Brioche is definitely another worth ordering. it is a sandwich that tasted like a Montreal smoked meat sandwich. SO GOOD that it melts in your mouth - so soft and tender. If it wasn't because we had ordered so much food and this was the last main course that showed up, we would have devoured it.\n\nFor dessert, we had ordered the Foie and Nutella, as we thought this was very interesting.

The decor it a bit cheesy with faux Roman sculptures. \n\nService was very good. The waiter was quick with our drinks and food and was helpful with suggestions. \n\nNow to the food. My husband ordered the veal parm and I ordered a pasta with chicken. We ordered brushetta as a starter. I noticed from the menu that, while a lot of selection, many of the pasta dishes were a bit uninspired. A lot of very basic dishes. Pasta with mushrooms and red sauce, or pasta with shrimp and pesto, etc. I really enjoy creative combinations and flavours when I go to an Italian restaurant, because quite honestly, I can make the basic stuff at home...for a hell of a lot cheaper.\n\nThat said, the pasta dishes were solid, if nothing special. My pasta was well cooked, but the chicken tasted like something you would find in a McDonald's salad and the mushrooms were good, but that was the basis of the dish. My husband's was basic, but veal parms usually are. He did note that there was a LOT of sauce on his. There was, but I like that personally, if there is bread to dip into it...but no bread was served to our table, other than the bread from our brushetta. \n\nThe brushetta wasn't great. The tomato mixture on top was good, but the bread wasn't properly toasted, so it got soggy and couldn't hold its shape. It kept falling apart when you picked it up. \n\nThe desserts really brought this place back for me. I had their homemade creme brule and it was really excellent. On the menu it tells you which are made in-house and I would highly recommend getting one of those. \n\nOverall, it was quite expensive for pretty basic Italian food, so it didn't stun me.

My only comment would be the washrooms, which feature communal sinks, the kind you find in elementary schools, where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around. Besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands, it's also wasteful if you're the only one there. Strange concept. Throw back, but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch.  \nNow onto the important part...the food and service.\nService started out alright and then immediately got very slow. It took some time to get our drink orders and then took a LONG time to get our actual orders. \nI ordered their French toast, my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger, fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float. I also ordered a side of bacon...and was told that they were out of bacon...which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely, or would be served without bacon. I'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon? Even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous.\nWe also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves. These were delicious.\nApparently my meal was the one that took the longest. The others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out. Who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves?\nMy sister said her tostada was quite good. My French toast was nothing special. The toast was \"fancy\", rounded pieces, on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between. The \"maple\" which was supposed to be on the plate (maple syrup I'm guessing) was barely present. Tasted like something I could have created with some ease.\nMy husband's dish was the best by far. His burger was juicy and this fries were great. The float was a little silly...this big, meaty burger and fries covered in more meat...paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers. (Not insulting, we just got a laugh). \nNothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay.

I've never had charcuterie before and I'm not generally a big meat eater, so this was a little out of the box. That said, I like trying to be adventurous and trying new things, so when are visiting friends suggested we give it a go, we went for it. Dinner service is open at 6pm, so we agreed we'd arrive at 6pm. We got there at about 6:15....there was already a HUGE wait for a table, but we managed to wrangle seats at the bar. \n\nThe four of us ordered a bunch of dishes to split between ourselves. We tried the charcuterie (sort of a platter of assorted sliced meats and p\u00e2t\u00e9), horse tar tar, roasted bone marrow, pork carnitas tacos, tongue on brioche and the foie gras and nutella for dessert. \n\nThe dishes came out staggered, so we got to sit around chatting and enjoying ourselves and our cocktails. The charcuterie came out first. It was assorted sliced meats arranged on a wood plank and served with bread. It was actually really nice. Next was the horse tar tar. This was a stretch for me. I don't generally like to eat animals that I LIKE. The people I was with convinced me to try a small bit and I must say, it tasted pretty good, but on principle, I just have trouble with it. Sorry! I hate being one of those people who doesn't have a problem killing the \"ugly\" animals, but doesn't want the cute ones to die...but I am. \n\nNext was the bone marrow, which was....well let's just say I had to keep telling myself not to think about what I was eating. Basically, it's a big bone and the marrow is of course in the middle and has been cooked so that it's almost the consistency of warm butter...pretty fatty and oily looking. You scoop it out with a spoon and put it on bread. It's actually delicious, but feels like you're eating something you shouldn't, purely for health reasons if nothing else! It feels like eating pure fat....tastes as good I suppose. \n\nWe had the tongue on brioche, which I was only okay with. The tongue was sliced and presented as a sort of Montreal smoked meat. We were told to open it up and eat it like an open faced sandwich. This made it easier to split certainly. The meat itself was very tender and the brioche was great, but the meat had a horseradish (I think) sauce, which was a bit overpowering. \n\nFinally we had the tacos, which was probably the more \"normal\" thing we had. I actually thought those were my favorite. Wish it was one of the more exciting things, but nope. Those tacos were excellent. \n\nThe foie gras with nutella was also delicious. It was served on a banana bread, over a nutella spread...but the fois gras was superflous. It didn't add any taste and was overpowered but the nutella and basically didn't add anything to the dish. Could have been served without. Clearly just added to SAY it was there. \n\nSo what's the overall opinion? Well, the restaurant is too small. It's REALLY small, but popular. Wish it was in a bigger location. Sitting at the bar was kind of interesting, because all the cooking was done behind the bar, but that was a small workspace and it got hot, because the oven, dishwasher, stove top and so forth were always turned up very hight. Impressive how they work in such a space though.\n\nOverall the food was very good. SOMEONE knows what they are doing. However, it is quite a pricey place and as I said, sometimes the flavours overpower the meat, or the meat just isn't even necessary. Sometimes you're paying extra for fancy meat dishes that don't even need the meat, or where you can't TASTE the meat. \n\nThose are the only criticisms, but I wouldn't let that keep you from trying this place...but only if you're willing to go out on a limb a bit and as something different. This isn't a go-to place, but it's a fun place to have gone to! \n\nOh...PS - They don't accept credit cards.

Had heard good things, which is why we chose Second City, as opposed to the cheaper Bad Dog Theatre. \n\nI should mention that it was a lot less improv than I expected. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, but it was basically, short, individual skits, creating a sort of sketch comedy act, as opposed to improv. This isn't a bad thing. I'm a HUGE fan of SNL, but I was say that I probably laughed more consistently during this performance, than your average episode of SNL. This is because of a combination of personal \"current Toronto\" jokes and because that's the way it should be when you have a couple of months to be putting together your next show, as opposed to one week (as with SNL). I would only expect a more refined show. In addition, we came close to the end of this show's run, so the kinks would presumably be figured out and they told us they were testing some of the new material on us, so that was kind of cool! \n\nThe skits were mostly successful, none failed to make us laugh out loud at least once. There were no weak links in terms of the actors, but the stand outs (for me) were a red headed girl and the black guy....sorry I have no names! I can only go by really obvious characteristics. \n\nWe stuck around after, as they did a little bit of actual improv and another skit, which seemed like an idea they were trying to hash out a little more. Well worth the sticking around even later for!\n\nWhy the lack of one star? Well those pictures down below don't really accurately describe what this place looks like when it's full of people. The chairs are small, there is no coat check and you're all crammed around a very small table. Your coats end up...wherever basically. \n\nProbably because I booked the tickets on the Wednesday before (I'm not sure how they determine seats...it's not first come, first served and it's not on your ticket...that I could see), we originally ended up in a back corner, on high bar stools. My skirt made it so that I kept sliding off the seat! I asked if there was any way we could be moved into regular seats, but the only thing left (and this is how I know seats are prearranged, because there were tonnes of empty seats all around at that time), were right in the front, next to the stage, but to the far side. From this angle, you can't see everything, but we enjoyed it more being right up, near the action. \n\nThat said, it was still VERY crowded and uncomfortable. Tickets are $30 each (here is a tip...it's a little less if you have a CAA membership and order through them), so that's pretty pricey. The show makes it worth it, it truly does. The seating takes away from it. \n\nBUT you can order drinks, which we did and that make just about anything better, so hey! \n\nAt the end of the day, I'll just make sure I wear pants next time and order tickets further in advance and either way it won't stop me from checking out another performance.

The girl on the phone said that it usually worked out, because once people had dessert and a drink, it worked out to be enough. As I said below, let's round up and say dessert is $20...so she's saying their drinks are $28!??! \n\nI have wanted to go to Moroco for my birthday since the summer, but that was before I realized how pretentious they are!

Timing was perfect between courses and the meals were very well done.  She got the twin lobster tails with asparagus and rice pilaf and I got the prime rib with a baked potato.  The tails were perfect and the rice pilaf was a bit different, but very fresh and not overly salty.  My prime rib was a bit on the rare side, which I usually order medium rare, and a bit unevenly cooked.  But the flavor and crust were phenomenal so that evened out to me.  Every bite melted in your mouth.  Never even used the au jus or horseradish sauce (which was a bit too bland for me, then again I used to grow my own!).  \n\nWe don't do dessert, but by the looks, and empty plates from those around us, they were excellent.

This was the best decision we could have made for the following reasons:\na) We discovered the mirrored hallway and pink walls. \nb) We also discovered the sexiest bathrooms alive.\n3) I would've never known about the swanky reclining booth seating upstairs that was set away from everything else. \n\nUpon heading downstairs I inquired about the upstairs. I was told it was usually saved for when the downstairs was full, but upon stating it was my birthday party, we were kindly allowed upstairs. We ended up having enough people for 2-3 booths so this was great.\n\nThe waiter started out great at first. Refilling water and being patient on the rest of our crowd to arrive. When we all got the point where it was time to order, things started getting confusing and the service started becoming very slow. I received the wrong pizza. I was able to finally get the right one after a little discussion and time, but by the time that happened I had been munching on other things and it was also close to when we were leaving so I had to box it all. Good part? It still tasted delicious for dinner tonight. When the time to get our checks came it got insanely confusing and several people had the wrong items on their checks and had to get a new check printed several times. \n\nThe food menu is limited and the service is slow, so I'm not sure I'd return here for dinner again, but I won't say I will never go back. Their drink menu is AMAZING. I was so excited to see such a great list of champagne cocktails and other items. The place is also insanely sexy. I love the lighting, the music, the seating, and the history of the building. I however do not like walking into where the elevator used to be. Hot pink daisy on our table?

I did ask KEVAN about this customization and he did not approve such a thing.  We are a franchise and unfortunately NOT allowed this.  I agree with you!  Mango&Passion is NOT a WACKY drink.  Alas the higher powers that be do not allow this.  In fact NEVER.  Trouble has been issued to us for such WACKY concoctions.  Silly?  I concur.\n\nI do hope you re-consider your review about this matter.  We really can't do it.  Your disdainful rating will have to stay with us.  You can hate us, be long gone with us, and be happy at Starbucks.  We try our best and if we messed up your drink.. Sorry again.  \n\nYou can go to the other Kung Fu Tea... They will get in trouble.  In fact you just got them in trouble.  No stamp cards there either.  I think YOU should question them about it.  Not us.\n\nDominic\n************UPDATE/RESPONSE*** 9/20/2016**********************\nThank you for your reply.\n\nWho are you suggesting I question, and about what?\n\nAs a point of clarification, in the past Kevan made these drinks for us himself. It wasn't necessarily a matter of needing his approval?... regardless, I completely understand now that it was not something he \"should\" have been doing and that you are bounded by rules.... rules that do not reflect amazing customer experiences.\n\nDominic I'd be more than happy to give your store the 5 stars it deserves, but you too are missing the big picture. You FAIL to acknowledge it in your reply as well. You failed to show us how much you CARE about our needs as the customer. You expressed understanding about our frustrations... BUT as the OWNER you offered NO further solutions... as simple as\n\n \"I will continue to submit requests the to the powers that be for this alteration as I understand this change will make many of my customers happy.\" \n\nYOU are the person in the best position to express this need and push for the changes to occur.

I love the blue sky and clouds mural on the ceilings and the light effects they do to mimic day light. The casino floor is nice, but I think Paris thinks a bit too highly of themselves because their table minimums were awfully high, and their poker tourneys were set at buy-ins that were so high that they were only filling half of the field.\n\nHowever, Paris does have one little thing that sets it apart from every other place on the Strip: their breakfast buffet. This breakfast spread they have, set in a Parisian village theme, is absolutely out of control. I have never in my life seen so many different options on a breakfast buffet. At $30/person, it's steep, but it is an experience you'll never forget. In the \"you're not going to believe this just happened to me\" Vegas-story fashion, my buddy and I are standing in this incredibly long line waiting to pay our $30 each and these two incredibly cute girls walk out of the buffet area and headed over to us. They asked us if we'd like two free coupons for the buffet; of course we took them graciously and chatted for just a minute. They had to go to the airport and weren't going to be in town to use them. They informed us we didn't have to wait in line, we could just walk in -- and walk in we did. Certain things in life are just perpetual game-changers, and Paris' breakfast buffet is one of them.\n\nEverything you ever wanted or could dream of wanting for breakfast was there. Since that experience, it's been a tradition that every time I'm in town, I go to Paris for breakfast only. They can keep the gaming and sell that to the tourists. If I want to game, I'll go to the MGM, Rio, Caesars or the Bellagio. In fact, Paris could just close its casino as far as I'm concerned and keep the breakfast buffet open.

Our waitress was extremely attentive and good-natured. I had a number of questions about the menu and she was able to answer all of them with ease and provided a number of good recommendations. I was initially seated at one of the tables at the back of the patio, but was hoping to sit at a booth. One of the booths became available while I was waiting for my friends to arrive, and our server was more than willing to allow me to change tables.\n\nThe dishes are fairly small here so we ordered a number - some we shared and some we had to ourselves.\n\nFor myself I ordered:\nOntario Spring Salad - this had good fresh vegetables, but I found the dressing to be really oily and I didn't like how salt and pepper were already on the salad when it was served as I found the salad to be quite salty.\n\nOl' shrimp bucket - this was a really yummy dish! I was surprised by the number of shrimp I received (maybe 11-12 large pieces) as I believe this dish was cheaper than the peel-your-own shrimp from the bar yet had more shrimp!

Here is what we ordered:\n\nScallop and crema - this is not at all what I was expecting. It was more like a scallop ceviche. It was a cold dish of chopped up scallop on top of crema. I asked if we could have it with the crema on the side and was immediately shot down. I really dislike when restaurants do this and do not accommodate for even slight adjustments to their menu. When the dish arrived, the scallop had literally been scooped on top of the crema, so it could easily have been prepared with the crema on the side.\n\nGreen tomatoes - this dish had dollops of chicken liver with tiny slices of fried green tomatoes on top, and then a bed of mixed greens placed on top of all of that. There was a good kick to the chicken liver, but I wouldn't order this dish again.\n\nShrimp and greens - about 5 pieces of grilled shrimp (cooked well) on top of a lot of buttery-oily sauce, with oily saut\u00e9ed spinach on top. The shrimp were really yummy, but I found the spinach to be quite flavourless.\n\nMackerel - long thin piece of grilled mackerel on top of a salsa verde that was strongly flavoured with cilantro.

I came here with two friends for dinner on a Friday night. I wanted a reservation around 6 or 6:30, but they only had 5:30 available. \n\nThe ambiance and environment is really cool here. It's too bad that the restaurant doesn't have a patio as I'm sure the decor could have been really well done on one. I had the sense that the design was aiming for a rustic, run-down, side-of-the-road Mexican establishment, but with a hip and edgy vibe, and I would say they certain accomplished that feeling. As other reviews have mentioned, there are no paper menus. Their offerings are simply listed on chalkboards on the walls. I did not have an issues with reading the boards as I was sitting right in front of one and the restaurant was not too busy, but I could see how it would be a pain if you are ordering multiple rounds of food or drinks (which is how they recommend ordering) to have to constantly remember what each dish contains. The washrooms are clean, but I only saw a single room for ladies and a single room for men, so I imagine that there can be a line up at times, especially later in the night.\n\nDishes we ordered:\n\n1) Guacamole and chips - my friends were disappointed that it did not come in a mortar bowl (how it is served at Playa Cabana) because it gave the sense that it was not quite as fresh. Apparently the guac does have a slight kick to it.\n\n2) Fried quaso chihuahua - my friend likes this, but it was also a bit spicy. It is literally a block of fried cheese on a tortilla\n\n3) Kalbi beef taco - we were told that this would be little pieces of charred beef cooked medium-rare. We were all disappointed to see that the meat was definitely more cooked than medium-rare. It was more like medium-well.\n\n4) Baja fish taco - I asked for this to be grilled, not fried, and to have it without the aioli. The waitress was happy to oblige. It was a good dish and I really like the slaw that is served on top, but I thought that the fish was slightly undercooked and I found that the tortilla had gotten a bit soggy (possibly from the fish?) which made it hard to eat. Despite this I was happy to see that they were not stingy on the amount of fish that they provide!\n\n5) Grilled calamari with burnt arbol kimchi - the calamari was delicious, I would definitely recommend ordering it! I did not find that it came with a lot of kimchi, and do not order it thinking that it is like Korean kimchi, because it isn't.\n\n7) Jumbo shrimp taco - this really was a jumbo shrimp which is tempuraed, placed on a tortilla, and loaded with a bunch of toppings. My friend said it was rather spicy, but she really liked it.\n\nService - I am a bit torn about what to write about this. I had the opposite experience to what other reviews have mentioned. Our server was extremely pleasant and very engaging. She took the time to go through every dish and offering with great detail when we told her that we had not been to the restaurant before. I have a friend who is both vegan and sensitive to gluten (she was not with me on this visit) and so I am always on the look out for places that can cater to both carnivores and people with dietary restrictions. I asked the server about one of their dishes (the portobello fajitas) because it sounded like it could cater to my friend's needs. The waitress said it would fit the bill and she also suggested other dishes that can be adapted to fit my friend's needs. This aspect of service gets five stars! I called earlier in the day to see if it would be possible to change our reservation from 5:30 to 6 because 5:30 is a bit early for dinner. I was told that this would not be possible because there were other groups coming in at 7, and that the restaurant tends to get busy around then. When we arrived at the restaurant at 5:30, we weren't too hungry so we thought we would just enjoy some drinks and guac with chips while we figured out what to eat. I got the sense that they wanted us to move along and order our food because they didn't want us to take up the table for too long. When we left at 7:20, I was surprised to see that the restaurant was only about 60-70% full. As a result, it was disappointing that we were felt a bit rushed earlier on in the meal. We also did not ask for our bill, it was simply placed on our table when we had finished our plates and we were not given the chance to ask for separate bills (although our sever was happy to enter individual amounts when we paid).\n\nOverall I had a good time at Barrio Correano, but I do not feel any real urgency to rush back.

I was really excited to try Catch because I love seafood and it came highly recommended by a friend.\n\nThe restaurant wasn't too busy when we arrived, but it filled up pretty quickly. It is a small establishment, so if you are keen to go then you may want a reservation. As other reviewers have mentioned, the restaurant becomes extremely noisy and it is very difficult to hear your companions speak. I am a young person and had to ask my friends to repeat themselves on numerous occasions. The decor is pretty basic although they do have interesting serving plates. I also liked how there is a very open kitchen (look to your left when you enter) so you can see everything the chefs are doing.\n\nService was satisfactory. There was a bus boy and it seemed like his only job was to clear plates and fill water glasses. Our glasses were never empty, but he always seemed to be at our table. This could be fixed if they used bigger water glasses!\n\nThere were a few things that irritated me about our service that made me feel like the waitress was trying to increase the size of our bill:\n\n1) My friend and I wanted to share a glass of white wine and she clearly explained this to the waitress and asked her to bring a second empty glass. When our waitress came back, she returned with two rather full looking glasses of wine. When we asked if that was one glass that had been split in half, she said she had thought we ordered two glasses of wine.\n\n2) When asked about dish recommendations, she always suggested the more expensive of two options. This happened twice to me, so it seemed a bit suspicious.\n\n3) As other reviewers had mentioned, the waitress recommended a pound of fish per person if you go for \"the big catch\". But, there were no fish that were 1 pound, the smallest was 1.5 pounds. You also hVe to be careful because the prices of the fish are not indicated on the specials chalkboard and you have to ask for them. Prices ranged from about $50 to over $80.\n\nThe reason why this restaurant gets three stars rather than two is because of the food. Three of us ordered:\n\n1) Gazpacho ($10) - this was the worst dish of the meal. It was a gazpacho soup with seafood garnish. (1 shrimp, 2 very small scallops, a hunk of white fish, and a few rings of calamari). The calamari was extremely chewy and I personally found it to be inedible. The flavour of the gazpacho base was decent and had a bit if a kick, but I found it to be rather salty and disgustingly oily such that I couldn't finish it. I would never order this dish again... and it came recommended from our waitress. \n\n2) Tuna Cesar salad ($11) - this was a decent portion and my friend liked it.\n\n3) Clams linguine ($19) - another good sized portion and my friend finished it off, so I think he enjoyed it! It was a bit odd that they did not give him a spoon for the linguine or a side plate for his empty shells and he had to ask for both.\n\n4) Sea diver scallops with a sweet pea pur\u00e9e and a bacon garnish ($29) - my friend loved this dish and said she would definitely order it again. I tried a bite of one of her scallops and would have to agree that they were quite well cooked.\n\n5) Roasted halibut with a zucchini leek side ($30) - this came with two good sized fillets of halibut. The fish was cooked perfectly. The zucchini leek side consisted primarily of olives and capers, and I did not find much zucchini or leek. Might would order this again if I came back to the restaurant.\n\n6) Saut\u00e9ed kale and spinach with roasted garlic ($5) - my friend ordered this as a side to her scallops. I had a bite and I thought that the greens were fine, but rather flavourless. I wouldn't order this dish again, but would try a different side instead. \n\nThe scallops and the halibut were what elevated the restaurant from two stars to three. There are many other interesting restaurants in the area, and new ones are constantly opening. I wouldn't go back to Catch just for the halibut and the scallops.

I ordered a cucumber roll and the sunomono salad (seafood, seaweed, cucumber, and a sweet vinegar. The cucumber roll and salad came quickly and I decided to order a second order of the sunomono as the serving size appeared quite small. This second salad also appeared quickly. After waiting for about half an hour without any sign of my friend's food, we decided to inquire about it. It turns out that the waitress had not heard the order for the special of the day, so it had not been prepared. At this stage I was a bit confused about why the waitress had not come to check in on us earlier as we were sitting with three plates of untouched food in front of us for about 25 minutes (I had not touched my food as I was waiting for my friend to receive hers). Her plate came quickly after we fixed this mix up.\n\nThe cucumber roll was quite large (8 pieces) with a lot of rice and chunks of cucumber rather than the finely sliced slivers I typically expect. The seafood in the sunomono salad was crab meat and two pieces of shrimp. I found the dressing to be quite salty and one bowl contained considerably more dressing than the other. My friend said her beef teriyaki was good, although it wasn't an outstanding dish.\n\nThe smaller restaurant got rather busy during the lunch hour and the server was getting a bit overwhelmed as she was tending to everyone on her own.

EXCELLENT\n\nThis particular location has a lot going for it and some not so much. The things I like most about it, is the location and the interior. This location is found right smack dab on the corner of Fish Hatchery Road and Park Street which is a HUGELY traveled intersection near downtown Madison. Plenty of sitting space, some comfy chairs and even a darkened area that seems... I don't know, quaint. It isn't super busy every time I have been here but it isn't dead either. Staff has been sometimes inattentive and once or twice downright rude but it only happened once or twice so I won't hold it against them. They also have an internet area in the back I think. I tend to stay toward the front of the store so I am not sure but I thought that was a really nice addition. 9 out of 10 times the store is spotless and finally it isn't cramped.\n\nNow onto some not so nice things (Sad Face). So the things I dislike most about this location are 1. the bathroom, and yes I know it seems mundane but if you read some of my other reviews this can make or break it. It isn't always as clean as it could be to put it nicely. \n\nAnother issue I have, Ironically enough, is the location. I know I said I enjoy the location and I do but it is right on the main drag so if you are there on a nice summers day or around 8:00, 12:00, or 4-6:00, all you will see is bustling traffic. Which, if you are trying to relax, is not the first thing that springs to mind. The other issue is that it doesn't seem to be as busy as it should be for being where it is. Why isn't that place packed all day! The reason I have found for this is that there is not much parking without walking a bit, which is great in the summer maybe or if your younger, but not so much in the winter. There is street parking but it is regulated so much that you would end up moving your car anyway. They have about 6 spots along the back of store but thats it.\n\nSo because I love their coffee and atmosphere so much this place gets a difficult 5 stars. The reason if because I don't want to have to park on a greatly busy street and cleanliness of the bathroom. Otherwise? Great staff, Free WiFi, Great coffee, Great Decor, Great Food, And Great Coffee... Oh did I say they had Great coffee too?", "business_id": "O615O_US381DcvkxwuEz7A", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-03-21", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "G5BqF32PyIQ5IvplDvpKnA", "review_id": "EQ64xydnGw9HWPZ9JUui4w", "text": "What a massive store in a sleepy little town near Madison, WI.

Gelato holds a special spot in my tummy... It's one of my fave frozen treats. Charlotte now has a legit gelato place in a great location. This cute little gelato shop popped up in the middle of Park Road Shopping Center. \n\nLike most gelato shops they had a variety of flavors made with locally sourced ingredients. They had about 8 flavors ranging from the requisite vanilla and chocolate to fresh cantaloupe sorbetto and lemon ricotta. Make sure to sample a few! Every flavor I tried was good. I recommend getting the medium size ($5) which allows you to get up to two flavors! I decided on chocolate and stracciatella. Fantastic combo!\n\nThe store was aesthetically pleasing. White building, nicely decorated interior, but the thing I didn't like was how the gelato was presented. I'm used to gelato shops creating elaborate displays of their gelato. I usually pick it based on how good it looks in the tray (yeah, yeah... how vain of me... lol). I couldn't actually see any of the gelato until it was scooped out of the container.

The entry process is pretty simple. Walk to the building, pay your money ($10 for admission and skate rental) and grab your rental skates at the next window. \n\nThe negatives... I was disappointed by the ice quality and the rental skates. The surface of the ice was pretty rough and needed a serious resurfacing. The rental skates were extremely dull. Yes, I know that they are rentals but it would have been nice if the blades had a decent edge. I also wish that they would have set up some cones inside the rink. This would have provided better separation for general skaters (the people that just want to skate circles) from the more experienced/technical skaters (the people that want to spin and jump). I've been to rinks that used the cones and it provided a better experience for all skaters. It would have been helpful if all skaters were aware of skating etiquette... There were also a few times that I found myself having to dodge people going the wrong direction!! \n\nThe positives... They serve beer and wine!! If it wasn't so early in the day, I would have partaken. The employees that I interacted with seemed friendly enough. \n\nPineville Ice House doesn't have a lot of competition, which means they really don't need to change much to stay in business.

First of all, there are 2 types of chicken: fried and citrus grilled. The fried is by far the most popular and it is made in abundance. The grilled seems to be a rare commodity because when we ordered it they said it would take 20 minutes. It ended up taking 30 minutes to get any of our food, so unhappy face for that one.\n\nThree registers but only one being used to take orders, hence the line is out the door. Unhappy face #2.\n\nPlace is rather chaotic and disorganized. Worse yet, the floor was covered in grease - you could practically slide on it. Pretty gross.\n\nDespite all of this, the food is still worth trying, but I recommend being selective. The grilled chicken is quite good, juicy, and was enjoyed by all. Adding a squeeze of extra lime kicks it up another notch. Thumbs up on fried bananas and the bread. I would not bother with the rice or cole slaw - both are forgettable. \n\nBottom line: Best bet is to just order chicken only and use the drive through. Serve it at home with your own rice and other goodies and you'll be happy. Probably worth trying the fried chicken and the empanadas. If they add another more convenient location, then I will be back for some chicken that is an alternative to the Crazy one.", "business_id": "UeMt6BCYA_ETI67HcYK7jQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2017-10-17", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "PQAR1z013WjtH6bMl5295A", "review_id": "tG6vttllz_4-HRU5bGnwnQ", "text": "Been to Fogo de Chao (the standard), Texas de Brazil and now Via Brazil.

It was hectic that day (apparently track season was starting) but I would not have known nonetheless because the level of attention I had was as if I was the only person in the store.  The lady fit me for my shoes, had me run outside in a few different pair, and I was off.  Really, you don't know how good a shoe is until you put some miles on it.  WOW!  You know, it was really interesting to see how well the staff person did with just some information (i.e., \"These are old.\"  \"My shins hurt\" etc).  I found the shoe for me.  It had been several years since I shopped at Elite and I was really impressed that time.\n\nFast forward to winter 2015.  I won a marathon entry and found myself in the middle of the third coldest February in Pittsburgh history--figures.  I went in looking for some running inspiration and maybe some warmer layers and I had another really good interaction with a staff member there.  They helped with picking what has turned into my favorite running pant (after trying at least three from other stores) and it was a good, genuine interaction.\n\nI am happy to say my return visits continue to be positive.

I was kind of underwhelmed.  The parking lot is a disaster.  It needs resurfaced and it's hard to navigate.  The waiting area is tiny and congested.  The patrons are suburban families looking to feed their families and I noticed large parties.  \n\nYou got your atypical chips and salsa.  We had a good (no, actually, she was great) waitress that was very attentive to our needs.  I had just gotten off work and devoured chips--she brough back salsa and chips.  They were just okay.  Too many broken pieces of chips in the basket which makes it hard to scoop the salsa.  It was not bland.\n\nI split a steak and chicken fajita meal with my father--it was sized for two to share and I was impressed with the serving.  It was good, but it did not come out sizzling.  I was a little disappointed with that.  They give three tortillas (not house made) which... was kind of disappointing.  If you want to take leftovers home, you can't really re-make without tortillas...  I guess you can ask for more but it just didn't make sense. \n\nI also had a tamale on the side.  It was just okay...  The masa was really good on the one side of the tamale--soft, flavorful, shredded chicken inside.  The other side was dry.  It was almost as if they didn't roll the tamale correctly before they steamed it.  Honestly, if they could have executed this correctly, it would have made my visit because everything else was... not that exceptional.\n\nSince I have to write something positive each time I want to say that our waitress was phenominal.  She was so attentive to everything from the aforementioned chips, to drink refills, to telling me that the fajitas came with guacamole (I had asked for a side of it not paying attention to the menu that it was included).  I really appreciated that.  Our table didn't have hot sauce on it (how can the busser miss that?) and she brought me her recommended kind.  \n\nI will not return, I was not impressed.", "business_id": "RUxAdd3mmNkejoTAX2YIDw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-23", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "g3V76Ja0XgWS1rqx0gxL_A", "review_id": "ouol6tzJzxUG-P0-ysgn5A", "text": "I like the Quiet Storm because it offers food as well as drinks.

I have been here once a week since they have opened and have been really happy each time.  Maybe it's the mood boost from all the vitamins being absorbed into my blood stream, who knows.  \n\nFirst off, thank goodness for Eat N Park and their corporate capital to bring a much-needed juicery into downtown Pittsburgh.  I think it's great.  I hope they do well.  The manager of the store and the employees are still going through their learning curve but I don't think it's unreasonable to expect that to last (per Justine's review).  They are less than a month old.  \n\nI've had the acai bowl as she spoke of and it was sweet--it's fruit based.  I guess I was not \"shoked\" by this...  It wasn't sweet like saccrine (ha!), or sweet from added sugar, but sweet from the fruit going into it.   They list each ingredient that goes into the smoothie, juice, or bowl.  I appreciated that.  I've tried their vegan protein and I was okay--it's plant based and not as forumlated as others.  It wasn't overly chalky.  \n\nI've had the green juice and I love it.  They don't serve it super foamy like other places which I appreciate because I hate getting a cup of juice with 1/3 of it being foam.  Not cool.  \n\nThe only thing I would complain about it the price-to-juice ratio.  At the other juice bars around town you get a larger size juice/smoothie for the same price that you spend at Delicious Raw.  I don't think this will distract me from buying here because when I want a juice downtown, I'm happy to even have an option.  Staff is friendly, menu has options, in general I like this place.

I went on a weekday morning so that I could actually get a seat and have the food at it's prime--not cooked in a hurry to see how the food really was.  Well, that was also the only time I had, as well.\n\nI was greeted quickly and seated and given a nice cup of coffee.  They did an exceptional job of keeping the coffee mugs full (another reason  to go on a weekday) and it was good coffee.  \n\nI had to try the hot cakes, but didn't want to OD on carbohydrates so I got the Egg Combo with the speciality hotcakes.  The waitress recommended the banana oatmeal or the apple cinnamon.  I went with the banana oatmeal.  Two over easy eggs and bacon, though they offer sausage patties or links in both regular (sage) and hot.\n\nMy food came quickly and I was disappointed to find the eggs sharing the plate with the hotcakes.  I like my food separated and dippy eggs leave a residue that sometimes can't be mopped up with bacon.  I guess I would have preferred a plate with the eggs/bacon and a plate with the hotcakes.  \n\nThe eggs were cooked perfectly as was the bacon.  Crispy yet chewy.  I have to eat my eggs and bacon before I can eat my hotcakes, because, again, I don't like my food touching--especially something sweet and savory.  \n\nLet's talk about the hotcakes.  They were served with a big dollop of whipped butter which I loved.  Whipped butter spreads pretty easy.  I like that.  I'm picky.  Especially with breakfast.  There were slices of banana cooked in which I also liked.  They tasted like a diabetics worst/best nightmare.  They were sweet and fork tender like a nice pancake should be.  They would have been fine without syrup.  When I added syrup it felt like I was eating a slightly sweeter version of banana bread.  I wanted to stop at one.  I really did.  I really really did.  I was getting full.  I can stop eating food that isn't good without much of a problem.  I had a problem with that second hotcake\n\nMy other \"complaint\" is that is is rather expensive for a small diner.  I paid a little over $10 for my breakfast.  For $10, I would have preferred a more generous portion of bacon, at least.  My idea of pricing is a bit off, I guess, mainly because I live in an area outside of Pittsburgh that is a lot less expensive.  \n\nSo, I will go back, for sure.

I was smitten.  It was through this store I developed my love of cooking.  Time (and work) took me away from Pittsburgh for a few years but now I am back.\n\nA lot can be said about the Whole Paycheck stores popping up around Pittsburgh as well as the butchers in the East End (I will never go there) that have become trendy since I've left.  I'm just not interested in going to these stores as I like my \"tried and trusted\" stores in Pittsburgh.  McGinnis Sisters is one of them.\n\nI recently visited my trusted store and had a sub-par experience with a cut of pork.  I wasn't sure what to do, honestly, as I never expected to have this experience...  I emailed them to let them know of a wonky butcher experience (his description of the product was less than steller) as well as my cut of pork shoulder.  Wow.  I could not be more impressed with their customer service and dedication to their product.  They aren't just selling product, they BELIEVE in their product.  They offered to replace the pork shoulder and to work with their Meat Department manager to make it right.  \n\nWhen I returned to the store, the wonky butcher was there (this time he coughed into his glove and I'm pretty sure he didn't change it) but the other guys behind the counter were SO QUICK to help me.  I brought in the leftover pork and they replaced it, no questions asked.  I really do love McGinnis Sister's and try to talk them up whenever possible.

We were having to plan walks around when we wouldn't run into anyone. I just got back from a walk with her now and my mind is blown. The leash was slack the entire time, she sat whenever I stopped walking, and she even politely greeted another dog/dog owner on the way!

For our Main Course I ordered the Bistecca alla Don Corleone, which was  a Grilled Rib Eye Topped with Breadcrumbs, Capers, Anchovies, Herbed Red Wine Roasted Tomatoes.Perfect grilled steak, medium rare that was so tasty!  My husband had the Ravioli Caprese, Stuffed with Ricotta Cheese, San Marzano Cherry Tomatoes, Fresh Basil Sauce. Both the Steak and Ravioli had the most delicious tiny tiny cherry tomatoes pan sauteed on the top of them.   Other family had the Lasagna and the Fettuccine which were both very Italian and Very delicious. For Dessert I had the Pannacotta which was topped with a Bruleed Slice of Orange ( incredible ) and Blueberries!  Everyone enjoyed their dinner immensely.

We asked for the Chartecurie  Board of Cheese and Meat for two, The Spinach Salad with Sweet Potato, pepitas and Cumin Dressing, and Truffle fries. The Spinach Salad was delicious, the sweet potatoes were warm and the dressing spot on! The Truffle Fries were perfect, crisp and light with the delicious truffle oil on them. The Meat and Cheese tray was lacking - the two pieces of cheese were so tiny Not enough for one , let alone two people. The meat choices were good - topped with a couple of random nuts and raisins. I would not recommend this but the other choices were wonderful . The waitress was very attentive and water was refilled a couple of times.

I got the Brio potatoes which were very big and had this white sauce drizzled in which our server was a mix of ranch and cheese. Would recommend these. \n\nMy boyfriend got the New York strip which was cooked perfectly however was lacking flavor. It wasn't anything to rave about and could've used even just a bit more salt and pepper. This is the reason Brio doesn't get 5 stars.\n\nDessert was a chocolate lava cake and it was so darn good! Molten chocolate inside and the cake just fell apart and mixed in with the ice cream. Definitely recommend this as a great way to top off your meal. \n\nBrio was not as romantic as I had expected.

We had the Hawaiian Ceviche which was refreshing and filling. We previously tried the Lobster Bisque which was divine. This time we also had the Fried fish cakes, which were crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. He had the fried calamari sandwich and I tried the Baja Fish tacos. The Calamari sandwich was amazing. Thin strips were lightly battered and fried, then topped with French dressing and cole slaw. The bun was sturdy enough to hold everything in place and the calamari was very soft and tender. I couldn't believe that it was calamari. I never had a great desire for it because most of the time it is too rubbery and chewy. Not this one! I highly recommend it! The fish tacos were good, 3 of them on corn tortillas with sliced avocado and rice and beans. The rice and beans were nothing special but the tacos filled us up. I would definitely  go back for the Calamari sandwich and to try some other items on the menu.

I grew up essentially hanging out here with my friends in high school, getting fancy with our buttered noodles with different sauces each time..\n\nHowever, this was a sore disappointment. My husband and I have been here several times and each time it's mediocre at best. Tonight (8/4/15) I had the BBQ Pork Sandwich with a cup of Chicken Noodle Soup. Unfortunately, the pork tasted fairly bland (except for that burn of pepper in the back of my mouth) and it felt like it had been shredded, then under a heat lamp, drying it out and making it super chewy. It even looked like how pork looks when it's been sitting on the edge of a slow cooker for hours... Very unappetizing.\n\nThe chicken noodle soup EVERY TIME has been super salty. If you like really salty stuff (my husband does), then go for it. However, I think it's just their generic recipe that's way too salty. I think it's the same chicken that they put on top of all the other dishes so that's salted, then salted noodles, and salty broth.. Ugh. This is the third time I have had the soup specifically. I've complained in the past about it being salty and the manager said they had to follow the recipe set by corporate.. :/\n\nStaff has always been friendly, although a bit spacey. The cashier (young blonde girl) didn't really have any knowledge of the products. The person ahead of us wanted recommendations and the only thing she could say is \"it's good!\" to everything.

It sounded amazing. When our dinner was brought to us I was so stunned by how beautiful it looked I started pulling clams out of the shells and couldn't wait to taste it. At about the time I got all of the clams out, I realized that I was staring at linguine and clams. The waiter walked up and asked how everything was. I said, \"I bet this is going to be amazing, but it's not what I ordered\". I didn't want to send it back since I had already pulled all of the clams. It was amazing non the less and this experience gives me good reason to go back and try the Mediterranea. There are a ton of awesome looking dishes on the menu. Give this restaurant a shot. You'll love it and you'll go back.\n\n*Update* - I returned last night 8/14/16 and had The Mediterranea. It was great and everything I had hoped for. I also had the Vegetable Egg Rolls.

The pretzel bread was DELICIOUS. I wanted a whole pan on the bread. \n- Deviled eggs: They were pretty good, very creamy. There is a bit of a spice, but very mild. Also, they cut the bottoms of the eggs so they sit flat, so be careful when you bite into them. \n- Winter Vegetables (I think this was the name): They were refreshing and light! It was nice to have something to almost \"cleanse\" the palette. \n- Scallops (entree aka \"Large\"): They were a pretty good size (not too small - like some restaurants have). They were tendered and fresh. The broth (just a little on the bottom) was very good, and added some extra flavor to the dish. \n- Pork Shank (entree): MY FAVORITE!! The pork was so tender and flavorful. It literally fell off the bone when I was cutting it off. You honestly do not even need to sauce that it came with because it was so good without it - but I love sauces... It was amazing, and definitely my favorite item off the menu. \n- Corn (side): It was good, but a little too creamy in my opinion. It was a pretty big portion and you could definitely share it with 3 or 4 people. \n- Green Beans (side): There was a little spice, but nothing too hot or overwhelming - just did not except it. There were sliced apple pieces as well!\n- Broccoli (side): It was nice, and beautiful. There is a little spice in this, as well - just so you know. It was still good though!\n- Fingerling Potatoes (side): They were crispy (do maybe pan fried? Not sure), but they had an aioli sauce (under them I believe) that was fantastic! it was pretty good! My favorite side dish!\n- Apple pie (dessert): The filling was very good! They did have oats on the top, which were good! The pie crust itself was a bit hard to cut, and I did not like it that much. We also got it with ice cream (of course). Definitely shareable! \n\nThey have valet parking (that's free for Stoke!), so that was a plus. \n\nOverall, our server was very friendly and nice.

The vet suggested Taste of the Wild (which they did not have), and 2. We felt the food they provided was not up to par with someone we would want to give him.\nBy this time, it was already after 4. About 4:10. So we walk back to the grooming area, and there she is (about to call us). Anyways, we leave him there and I took the receipt - which I had to ask for so I could pay - to the register.\nThere was only one register open (out of the three they have) and I was the third in line, which is not a huge wait for me. But it was a holiday week, and fairly busy... Anyways, after a few minutes another register opens up but two people hop in that line. After what seemed like forever - my line started to move - YAY! But the person in front of us, had quite a few items to purchase and the cashier was complaining about how slow the computer was... We decided to move to another register (which had two other people), but actually went quicker than the first one we were in. I check in on YELP and received a $5 coupon for the salon, so I show them and it felt as if they have never seen this coupon before. The gentleman working did not know how to put the coupon in, so he grabbed another employee and she was a little confused so they got a manager. I would think that if they have a coupon out, they would make sure their employees know how to ring them in correctly - or at least know about the coupon. Anyways, I saw Rocky getting lowered so I told my fiance to grab him while I finish and pay. This whole time, the first register STILL had the same guy... \n\nI would think being a couple days before a holiday they would be well prepared and staffed accordingly. We ended up going to another pet store to buy his food, which is a little more expensive but healthier and better ingredients. I think next time we will go to another pet groomer and see if they are better. \n\nP.S. I have been here several times, and this is the worst visit.

It was a little brisk for me so we chose inside. We were sat at a booth and within a minute our waitress came over. She was nice, but low spoken so sometimes I didn't even hear what she was saying. The music was a bit loud too, I felt like I had to yell during my conversation. But they had a TON of televisions, which was good because we wanted to see the end of the 4 o'clock games. We both ordered a salad (mine was a house and he chose the ceasar). We both ordered the wings, last time we came was a whiiiillleee back and their menu changed just a little. The fries did not come with the wings but now they do!! The fries are good! Natural cut and not burnt or crispy. I loved them. And the wings were good, needed a little more sauce but you can always ask for more. \n\nOverall, the food was good for \"bar food\".

The gentleman that helped me was very polite and courteous. I did not know what my size was and he helped me decide which one was the best fit, size 5. The ring was going to be shipped off for two weeks and I was stuck waiting anxiously every second of every day. When I went back to pick up the ring, FINALLY, it was the same gentleman that helped me. It fit well. \n\nThe next time I went, I wanted to get my fiance his ring and my wedding band as well (I know it is super early - the wedding is in February 2018 - but I just could not wait and he was out of town for a few weeks). The young woman that helped me was amazing!! I told her what I wanted, because I already knew what two rings I needed to purchase. I got him a band as well as a personalized engraving and for myself, I just got a small plain band. I brought my friend in for her thoughts on what the engraving should say as well as emotional support. After wearing my engagement ring (after I got it resized to 5) I noticed sometimes the ring felt big... Not big enough to fall off. I brought this concern up to her, and she mentioned that sometimes when you are cold your fingers kind of shrink up (not her exact words, but that is the summed up version) so the ring may feel loose. This completely made sense to me, but she also suggest that she can resize the wedding band just a tad bit smaller than a 5. WHAT?!?! I did not know you can get a size in between whole and half numbers!! So she said she will write it up for 4.75 and if it was too small when I receive the ring we can resize it again to 5. This was absolutely amazing! While she was writing up the repairs, my friend and I were just chit-chatting about possibly getting my groom a watch for the wedding day. After everything was all said and done, she handed me the packet with the repair slip copies and she even threw in a coupon (because she heard us talking about the watch I was thinking about getting him).\n\nWhen I went to pick up my ring (my ring was finished early so I was able to pick it up before his was finished) another woman helped me out. She was a little older than the previous salesperson and she also seemed to be a manager of some sort because the other employees were asking her questions you would typically ask a hire-up. I told her I was here to pick up my ring, and she asked for the pick-up slip. I told her I had two, but I know only one was there. She handed me the ring (mine) and I tried it on and I was moving it around a little because I did get it small. She seemed to be a little annoyed maybe? Once I looked up with my satisfaction she asked if I needed anything else. I felt kind of pushed out almost? That is why I am giving four stars instead of five. After two days, I went to go pick up my fiances ring. The first salesperson that help me was the same young lady from before and she remembered my face because she asked what the last name for the ring was! It just felt nice that she remembered me! She handed me the ring, and I inspected it and I found a little nick above one of the letters. And I told her, she inspected it herself and even looked at the ring with a magnify glass. She wiped it down several times, and after she handed it back to me but I still thought I saw the mark. She let the manager know (the same one from above) and the manager looked at the ring and she said that since they use a diamond to do the engraving sometimes you get nicks on the ring. I do not know if that is true or not, since I have never had a ring engraved before. \n\nOverall, my recent experiences have been pleasant and informative. I have never had to purchase a ring before so I was almost clueless when it came down to it. I am most likely going to go back, since we purchased all of our rings though Kay as well as purchased the warranties for all of them as well.", "business_id": "nReKcz3OZ8yQqYfX_ZjiJQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2017-07-31", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "l6wqZwWnXt1l-NInReBufA", "review_id": "B1BcgJrYdvNmMmJ0q-r4Hg", "text": "Stopped in here during my lunch break (it was a full house) and we just had to wait a couple of minutes for them to finish wiping a booth down. \nThe service, overall, was decent.

It was VERY dry due to their choice of bread.  It was better when dipped in my bisque.  Unimpressive though.\n\nThe lobster bisque had very good flavor for being so cheap, but the array of veggies included (for texture?) was inauthentic and not needed.  They were a distraction from the lobster flavor, and the tomato, carrot, celery, and onion only added unnecessary bulk.  Don't expect it to be super creamy, as it was more watery than a true bisque (it's made with 2% milk instead of cream I bet).\n\nThe caramel creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e ($2.99) was fantastic with a crack of sea salt from the salt shaker.

I don't see why they don't have seating on their patio, or why they have a ping pong table out there taking up valuable space.\n\nI started with their $3.50 hot chocolate.  It was cinnamony, and the whipped cream definitely helped its richness.  I would have preferred it hotter and less syrupy, as it was slightly Hershey's chocolate milk flavored.  With bolder flavors (darker chocolate, more cinnamon) and a temperature increase it would be much better.\n\nI tried the breakfast pot pie which consisted of a sheet of flakey pastry topped with cream gravy (no large sausage chunks despite what the waitress said) that included many large chunks of undercooked carrots, and an egg sunny side up.  I added on a side of chicken sausage ($3.75) which was not tasty - very bland and a little dry.  I should've gotten the chorizo.  The hashed brown potatoes were undercooked.  Everything was cooling off when it was served, rather than being steaming hot.\n\nThe food was fine, but I didn't appreciate the multitude of undercooked carrots at all.  The gravy could've used more sausage and spice/heat.  It was a good idea for a dish, but the components outside the egg and basic puff pastry crust didn't deliver.\n\nService was okay, though I didn't care for the waitress splitting the ticket down the middle, instead of breaking it into separate checks.

His margarita was deliciously tart and had a definite bite of tequila which was nice - but unfortunately no salt rim, so we probably wouldn't get it again. \n\nFor food I ordered a deviled egg - they were out of these too, now I was officially disappointed. Husband had  couple of oysters to start and I went right for my main, the famous fried chicken thigh sandwich. It was very very good. I am not a huge avocado fan but it was very citrusy and added a really nice balance to the delectable fried chicken. The breading was crisp and the bun was perfectly soft. Fries on the side were good too mostly due to the homemade ketchup - a tangy/spiced version of the classic.\n\nHusband had the Yorkshire BBQ Pork. This was a surprising dish, really well composed and perfectly executed. The pork was essentially a barbecued loin with a nice crust on the outside and slathered in kansas city bbq sauce. It was beautifully cooked and paired so well with the sweetish sauce and meaty, rich collared greens.

He on the other hand was on top of everything, wherever our server slacked he made up for it. We waited maybe close to an hour before our chef came out and James was delightful! Like I said working this type of restaurant I've basically seen the typical show, but James did some things I haven't seen before and made it enjoyable. The food I honestly wasn't crazy for, it lacked a lot of flavor and their sauces desperately need a makeover. I really feel like the menu is way over priced.

They were very friendly and accommodating. My husband and I started with a caprese salad, and the diver scallops. The salad was lacking basil, but he scallop were superb. For our entree we ordered the bone in ribeye and the large filet mignon. We ordered both medium rare, unfortunately they both came back over done my husbands was about med-well and mine was med-medwell. We told our servers and the apologized and offered to make another one but we didn't feel like dealing with the hassle of waiting more. Oh!!! And the sauce they pour over the steak is awful is taste like gravy. I'm sorry if I wanted a meatloaf I would have ordered that and not a $60 steak. I understand all places have off nights but if your going to charge that much for a cut of meat then they should know how to cook it properly. Midrare and they make it midwell is a problem. But at the end of it they offered us free dessert. Again service was great but food was not much to be desired.

She explained that would cost extra, so I ask then why would you ask if I wanted ranch when I ordered. She ended up giving it to me at no extra cost. I was just a little annoyed by that. The wings were nice and hot and had plenty of meat. And I was pleasantly surprised that the boneless wings were so tasty!! Normally I stay away from boneless because they are breaded so much and there's no meat; but not here!!

Worst service and even worse management! First of all this is the 5th chance we gave them to get our order right because we do enjoy their food. They are 0-5. Each time we just placed an order for pick up and \"EVERY\" time (no exaggeration) there was something missing from our order. Either the salad, the bread or the cheese cake we ordered each time. The first time they told us to come back and get our salads...well we live over 30 minutes away so they refunded our credit card. The second time the bread was missing...we just let it go. The 3rd time...our cheese cake was missing. Is this a joke? Nothing worse than thinking you are going to have a nice piece of cheesecake with a glass of wine after dinner only to find out...once again you paid for something they forgot to pack. The fourth time we learned our lesson and checked the bags before we left the restaurant. Yep...once again they forgot the cheesecake. They got our cheesecake...no apologies...we left. The last and final time we will ever go there was on Monday 9/18/17. We got there right when the Monday night Giants game started. Again we just wanted to place an order to go as always. It took about 15 minutes to get a drink order and place our food order. It took another 10 minutes to actually get our drinks. Right before half time (yep it took that long to get a to-go order) the manager on duty brought us our bags of food. I politely asked if he wouldn't mind checking to make sure everything was there as we had problems getting everything we ordered the last 4 times. He said \"I know everything is there because I packed it myself\" and was very adamant about it. He then started rattling off what was in each bag. When he was done my husband said where's the cheese cake. The manager then ran to the back to get our two pieces of cheesecake. He handed them to us explaining that the dessert order go to a different area of the the kitchen so that's why that happened. Again just excuses...no apologies. It took forever to get our food order, which was incomplete again, and we were never asked if we would like another drink while we waited. The least he could have done was take the cheesecake off our bill. If you want horrible service with an attitude this is the place for you.

You feel as though you have to whisper and it's just really uncomfortable. The second time we went it was the same stuff just with more people dining. They really have something going right here with the food, but just putting on some music and getting an extra server would greatly improve the dining experience. Also, you can order food to-go (which we attempted to do for our first dining experience) but they won't tell you what's in a roll on the phone when ordering because people 'steal' his recipes.

I have to admit, with all the hype and 5 star positive reviews I have heard of this buffet (from friends, peers and other reviews) there was a heck of a lot to live up to. The result? Two thumbs up of approval. Absolutely AMAZING.\nUpon entrance, I was blown away by the decor. Stunning. The restaurant utilizes glassware for much of their decor, which made for contemporary, yet comfortable ambiance, garnished with an array of the most appetizing dishes I have ever seen at a buffet - and I have been to many around the USA, especially buffets in Las Vegas.\nI sampled everything. Starting with the Chinese food to the Mexican Sope (stuffed with zucchini flower and cheese) these were incredible - I could have eaten THREE. Next was the Wagyu Beef, Brisket, and the Suckling Pig - not fatty, full of meat, skin was cripsy - perfectly done and the chef on the meat station was a hoot! Ended the meal with an awesome selection of desserts. The dessert station - my favorite - where do I even begin? (salivate salivate) Most of the buffets in Vegas I've eaten at are overly sweet and taste like they've come out of a box. The desserts here are spot on. Gelato and Ice Cream selection is excellent. Some of the best ice creams I have ever tasted - lemon basil sorbet- heart heart. Rice pudding was refreshing and tart. The coconut macroons, Good Lord. For the holiday weekend they even decorated some of the desserts with little flags - super patriotic and thoughtful.\nOverall, I give this buffet 5 stars, A+++. Service was spot on as well, Super attentive. \nGreat attention to detail. \nIf you want a great meal, great dessert, and great service hit the Bacchanal.

The jewels were falling off the threads, there were BLUE stains under the armpits and it looked dirty...it honestly looked like it had been worn.

I was so disappointed in the dress that I did not take it and requested a new one to be shipped out. A couple weeks later, I get a call saying it was in and I could pick it up. This time, I took my mom and sister with me to pick up the dress. It looked great! \n\nAlterations- the main lady is really rude just FYI!! For my first fitting, my mom, sister and I went and while she was pinning and tucking away- she literally told us to be quiet! Are you kidding me?! We weren't being that loud- just enjoying our time together. Second time around she wasn't there and dealt with someone else. Alterations were good- just really expensive. They also do a complimentary steam- which we waited about a week before the wedding to do. All in all, they have beautiful dresses here for good prices so it's worth a look.

I felt bad I didn't leave a tip but it's my first time trying out the place and don't believe in tips until I've had it 2-3 times and they're consistent. I opened up the box by the beach and I already knew what to expect. I took my first bite of the fish and man was it tasty! The batter was delicious and the tartar sauce nice and light. The fish was tender, not too chewy and had a good taste.\nThe French fries. I usually prefer my fries cut as shoestring and seeing how big these were I was a little disappointed. I popped one in my mouth and these were some darn good fries. Crispy outside and nice on the inside. Lightly salted and then I proceeded to do something stupid. I put vinegar on them and it ruined the fries crispness. \nColeslaw. Not something I look forward to but even their coleslaw was good! Just the right amount of tanginess in the dressing and the green onion complimented it nicely.\nI gave a 4 star because it was only my first time there. In the future given consistency in their food it could be 5.\nIf you're a fan of fish and chips it's definitely worth a try. Even if you're not, this place has lots of potential.", "business_id": "StWSgLnWkuSocMbMcwEQkw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-07-14", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "Zet-4ohddzgYhG9v3iZAIQ", "review_id": "3TnRhPEArhsSJW_XZBdweA", "text": "Great service each time I visit Nikki.

We had to flag a waiter every time we need something then remind them 20 minutes later.  The whole dinner process was about two hours just because the service was slow.

He had a difficult customer at one point and he started screaming at him, all I could hear was his voice. Customer wasn't even yelling.. They started knocking on doors for people to move their car so other people could get out of the lot at 6am, so yeah people were upset. Rooms were okay, bed was kinda made terribly, 2 pillows on one bed were okay, but other bed had like travel pillows, not sure why. Breakfast included a minimal amount of food & they ran out of utensils, but i'm just happy breakfast was free. Would never come here again. We booked 3 nights but only stayed one due to how awful our experience was. --- this is an edit, we had to stay the night here again due to our relatives (in LV) having plans to go out of town and we had already paid for the room x3 days, so whatever, we'll just park our car in a parking space that looks easily accessible and hope for the best. Well at 1AM, staff comes knocking on our door... telling us we're blocking someone in. Someone so happened to pull in behind us and a bunch of cars blocked them in. We, of course, got up and moved our car only to be blocked in the next morning, courtesy of the housekeeper. We complained to the manager and he straight up gave us attitude, very sarcastic man.

I found out about the place through a cop. I was shopping or something in Lakewood and figured if anyone knew where the good coffee was in a particular area, it would be a police officer. I asked an officer who was standing around the stores where the best coffee in Lakewood could be found, and he directed me to The Root Cafe. Originally he directed me toward a fancy kind of coffee, I was thinking, because of the way he described this special filter for the coffee--a cone-like object that some people will be familiar with or know what I'm talking about--like the thing that you put the coffee filter in on a coffee maker. Not a french press but a more regular-looking thing. Anyway it turned out when I went to The Root Cafe and asked one of the employees about which kind of coffee the cop might have been describing that was so good, she told me he meant just their regular coffee--less expensive than the kind prepared using the special filter thing I described before. So I got a cup of regular. Indeed it was good coffee. Not necessarily the best, but good. \n\nI also enjoy the food at The Root. They have delicious molasses cookies, and the vegetarian dishes--they are all vegetarian--are satisfying enough that one might think there was some meat/protein-based item snuck into their sandwiches. After I eat something there, I am full.  \n\nThe only downside to this place is if you want to have an audible conversation and you go at one of the times of the week when they have a band.

Last night, my waiting ended as I and a friend dined at Players. I happened to have a $10 off coupon from \"The Deck\" for Cleveland Independents restaurants, and I used it at Players. All in all, I think it was a smart choice. The salad I had included Gorgonzola, which I enjoy normally. I asked the waiter whether he recommended the salad featuring that cheese--a more traditional take on fancy salad, or the one with pears and a vinaigrette. He simply asked if I liked Gorgonzola. I responded \"yes,\" and that was that--it was the salad that included that that I ordered. The salad was pleasant enough--nothing to write home about, but good. I ordered a pizza because I'd heard Players had good ones. I probably should not have for the price. I noticed they tack on an additional buck plus some change to each additional item added to the pizza--'nothing usual about that'  you might say. But when considering the size and quality of the dish, it turned out to be, like the salad, nothing to write home about. My friend made a wiser choice, though a more expensive one, in going with the crab cakes. He let me try a little and I discovered the flavor was more \"worth the price\" than my pizza. It was around $24 for his crab cakes. They were delicious, and I was particularly impressed with the asparagus that came on the same plate: it was cooked just right--not overdone and soggy, not underdone and too hard. Just right. I noted that his dish also included risotto under the crab cakes, which looked good. An overpriced adventure, minus the $10 off coupon we used. I do not plan on returning soon.

I just came because some friends of friends were all into this place. At first, I was like, wha?? entree = club admission? What kind of decent, respectable place does THAT? And my mind was confused as it did not match the flashy style of previously-mentioned friends of friends.\n\nSo a bit reluctantly but also curious, I went. Inside, I would describe the restaurant as dark and lusty. Yes, I said lusty. This is Vegas after all. Anyway, we were able to sit in the front bar portion without a reservation which was nice since it was a last minute thing. \n\nThe menu items don't actually sound that appealing to be honest. Rather plain, ho-hum descriptions. But when we ordered, my god, the portions were HUGE! I must've missed something about family style, but lordy, you could've fed a whole village of my ancestors. So of course, we ordered WAY too much food. But my favorite dish was the beet salad. I wish I lived closer to you, beet salad. I'd totally order you again and again. I also got a lobster bisque - too salty for me though, and a little creamier than I like. We had the risotto with short ribs which was sorta the oddity on the menu (one of these kids is doing his own thing). The waitress told us it wasn't ordered a lot, but I still wanted to try it. It was good, not the best. One of my friends loved it, but I probably wouldn't order it again. We got the meatball - tasty and the size of a softball. Then there was a veal dish that I didn't try. But back to you, beet salad. You were the best beet salad ever. Perfect balance of beets, goat cheese, greens, candied nuts, etc. \n\nSo I was about to roll over from being so full, but I love dessert so I ordered the bread pudding. Again, a huge portion shared by about 4 main people, and 4 supporting cast. It was yummm-my. A keeper. \n\nThen onto the club part and time to work off the billion calories just consumed. The waitress stamped our hands. We wandered around inside The Palazzo a little, then headed back to Lavo for the club portion. It was a little chaotic around the entrance/elevator, but the stamp allowed us to enter without waiting or paying. Big plus. Up the elevator, to the club. It's not very big, and all the tables are reserved with bottle service. Annoying because as a girl, you just want to have a place where you can sit or put your purse, coat, etc. Anyway, we danced but the place soon got VERY crowded, the DJ was just alright, and again, the fact that you can't really sit anywhere around the dance floor was a negative. So we left to meet up with a friend who was at the circular bar in the Palazzo casino. Honestly I had just as much fun, probably more, in the casino bar. \n\nIn the end, Lavo's food was a pleasant surprise, I didn't care much for the club, and I'd consider going back but it wouldn't be my first choice. I did like the casino bar though. I'd go there :)", "business_id": "VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-02-04", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "mVWYHUhnoG7r1CBAQ6PxEw", "review_id": "ZXzILW2qXKdUsqjYlGxYfw", "text": "Authenic flavor!

Even with an appointment I had to wait about 15-20 minutes which was odd because there was only one other patient waiting in the lobby. \n\nThe phlebotomist herself was very nice and did her best to help my one year old stay as calm as possible for her routine blood work. I was very nervous because this was my daughter's first time getting blood work and she's still so little! They ended up getting another phlebotomist to help me hold her down and keep her still so they'd only have to prick her once. As soon as they finished  they gave her a little sticker and she immediately stopped crying. The phlebotomists did a great job. \n\nI think you can go online to get lab results but you have to enter a bunch of information so I'll just wait for the results from the doctor's office. \n\nOverall not the best experience, then again, getting blood work isn't the most fun, pleasurable experience anyway.

I will add that the food portions also seem to be decreasing! We went during happy hour last week and I had the worst tasting rye drink possible - described as rye with fig jam, bitters and lemon, sounded like something that cannot possibly be fucked up, but tasted like nothing but the juice wrenched out of unripe lemons - super dry and gave me a stomach ache. No fig flavor to be detected. To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a \"yes, it's got lemon in it.\" When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, \"yes, it's a lemon and fig drink.\" More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks. \n\nAlso, their bar seating sucks.

I ordered all of the vegan options. I was not entirely impressed...\n\nThe amuse, a beet ceviche, was delicious -- I would have traded out my main course for a big bowl of it. The two bite portion was a true tease.\n\nCourse one was roasted potatoes, meh. These were served with a green tomato ketchup which tasted too much like heinz for me to give a shit. OK, it did have notes of apple which was slightly interesting. But also served on the side was a \"sour cream\" and onion dip that was pretty yummy and had hints of horseradish.  I think the \"sour cream\" base is the same as that used at Mad Mex.\n\nSecond course was Chilled English Pea Soup. I LOVE raw english peas, thus appreciated the imagination of this soup (I believe it was a raw dish). However, I would have just as soon cracked open fresh pods, enjoying the full texture of nature's candy. Toward the bottom of my bowl of soup, I realized that blenderization diminishes the essence of peas, and felt slightly sad.\n\nCarrot-lime intermezzo -- fine.\n\nThird course was a big disappointment. Roasted Porchini Arepas sounded exciting (\"what are arepas?\"), but it tasted rather plain. The arepa was dry; dying for some of that \"sour cream\" and onion condiment from course one. The mushrooms were delicious, as mushrooms are, and that is my only compliment for this course. Crispy sweet potato fries were served on the side, but again with no condiments and I had had my fill of potatoes at course one. This course lacked moisture and flavor all around.\n\nSo why three stars instead of two? Dessert was amazing. \"Strawberry Pound Cake\" is the strawberry short-cake I have been dreaming about for 13 years (about the length of time I have been vegan). Probably not all that difficult to make, but wow, those strawberries were good (I surmise they were local, yay)!\n\nThe mignardises, chili chocolate, was like a slightly spicy m&m. Cute.\n\nTo quote Kaya's website, \"The menus emphasize flavor and variety, presenting familiar foods in exciting ways, and making exotic foods delightfully accessible.\" I feel that exotic foods were completely lacking from this meal and that the emphasis was placed on creativity with familiar foods. Plantains would have been an excellent substitution for one of the potato dishes. The meal was full of \"American\" flavor with very little suggestion of \"island\" influence (ie. lime and cilantro). Perhaps they strive to use local ingredients, which would be cool, but there were no indications of that on the menu. No, I am not going to lay into a discourse to define \"American\" cusine, but hey, the restaurant is located in the U.S., admittedly serves \"fusion\" styles and the kitchen boys were white; probably studied culinary arts in 'merica. I mean that one should not expect an exotic experience at Kaya, though one should expect, demand even, an imaginative and quality meal.\n\nThe wine pairings were all perfectly on point; I owe much to this in creating what was generally a lovely meal. \n\nThe service was also excellent. We had come in from the rain and were soaked; the host brought us towels to dry ourselves. Our server made intense eye contact which, in my eyes, made her an attentive communicator.\n\nThe ambiance was nice, with exception for the tv airing CNN in the front corner; it wasn't obtrusive, but it was there. I did not care for the seating. The tables were close together, and there was a great distance across the table between my date and I, thus at Kaya, you will often be sitting closer to your neighbor than your companion. \n\nThankful to the date who paid,\nHeidi", "business_id": "Ul6JwluSTm12PVDIqnNaTg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-06-19", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "b4ZbEEDbCPT6pVT4ImJU4w", "review_id": "Sb2qREKc6WGyN1WbCIxmzQ", "text": "Currently operating as a \"pop-up\" sushi bar, but soon to open permanently in this location.

I admittedly tried booking somewhere else first, but this was my second pick so when the other spa wasn't able to accommodate, I was quick to call Spa Life. Fortunately they had the availability for what and when I wanted, so we were off to a good start! \nThe location is good and easy to find (the spa is immediately inside the main entrance, to your left). Lots of parking in a nice, big lot. Upon arrival, I was greeted by a friendly receptionist who asked me to fill out some simple paperwork regarding my massage needs and health. She then escorted me to the ladies locker room and provided me with a key to a locker, none of which I expected, so that was nice! The locker room is small but clean and pleasant. There are 2 small showers, 1 restroom stall, and a double sink vanity. They provide you with small lockers, a robe, sandals, towels, and there is a hair dryer, hair spray, and shower soaps for you to use as well.. Also none of which I was expecting! There's a small, quiet waiting area where you are directed to wait once you're finished in the locker room.\n\nMy massage was good, not great. I may have just not liked the specific modality that I requested, so I'm not going to put any blame onto the therapist for what could have been my poor judgement. However, apparently the sound system in the spa was \"down\", so the noise level was high.. the people talking around us, doors opening and closing, and random noises made for a distracting 90 mins. Also, because there was no music, my therapist was using Pandora from her phone, which kept being interrupted with advertisements and her phone kept vibrating from notifications. I just couldn't really understand why, if you had to use your phone,  you wouldn't silence it as opposed to using the vibrate setting.. that was super annoying.  I did mention the level of noise to the receptionist when I checked out, to which she apologized and said she would pass along to management (blah blah). She was nice about it but that didn't change the fact that it happened. \nOtherwise I had a decent experience. I'd say I'll more than likely return, trying a different type of massage this time and hoping that their sound system is up and working. Only time will tell! ;) \n\nTry it out for yourself though.

They replied promptly and were very informative - that was extremely appreciated!  I concern was that many of the reviews were regarding families with kids, or for a different season, so I wanted to make sure this would be fun for 4 adults as well.. if you're wondering the same thing, I'll save you some time and just tell you that it was perfect for us!  I purchased the 90 minute ride for 4 people (less than $150!), there were 2 other adults in our group (there may be up to 10 people) and we had a really good time!  The ride was easy, so it's perfect for beginners.  My mother in law is not comfortable around animals (not something you usually want to find out AFTER the fact, but oh well haha!) and she did great!  Her horse was gentle and they tail-to-nose the entire time, at a slow, easy pace.  Truthfully, if you have a lot of experience riding, this may not be your choice activity, as it is a \"perfect for beginners and kids\" activity.. so just keep that in mind!  The guides were really friendly and very eager to answer any and all questions we had throughout the entire ride.  There was a guide in the front and a guide in the back, to make sure nobody gets too far behind.  During our ride we saw a coyote which I thought was awesome!  We chose the sunset ride (end of June) so it was really very beautiful and peaceful. Another thing I really appreciated was that after we were all saddled up, they took one of our phones and took a couple pictures of us on our horses, and then took pictures of us riding which were available for purchase ($10 per photo), and we purchased all of them!  It was a really great keepsake that wasn't over priced!  \n\nThis was our first time partaking in anything like this, so while I don't have anything to compare it to, I can tell you that I can't imagine how it could get too much better.. and all the locals we spoke to about it agreed that MacDonalds Ranch is a great place to visit!

Second, when we got there, the bartenders were really super unhelpful. When you first walk in, you step right into the bar area.. it's small, dark, and kinda cramped.. kinda divey, which is not an issue, but if you're unfamiliar with the place, as we were, it can be kinda hard to find your way around.. and when the bartenders offer no help whatsoever, it makes it that much more awkward. So we finally found our way to the back patio, which is really super awesome. We sit down at the bar, only to be told that this bar has just closed.. ugh! So we grab a table, which was fine, just not what we had in mind.  \n\nFrom that point, the service was prompt and decent. Our server was friendly and helpful, and our food came out super fast. We got the queso as an appetizer and it was AMAZING. Seriously the best queso I've ever had anywhere. So good! I got the Shrimp Tacos as my meal, and they were good.. no super amazing queso, but good. My white sangria was decent. Again, nothing special but I enjoyed it.  \n\nBy the time we left, we both agreed that we were happy we tried it and we'll be going back soon I'm sure. I would definitely recommend the back patio, it's a really cool place with a great atmosphere.

We got our menus when we sat, and maybe it just wasn't what we were in the mood for at that time, but we were just not overly impressed with the menu.  We only ordered an appetizer (filled up on beer and junk food during the game, of course) and by suggestion of our server we ordered the Sunday Gravy, which I'll admit was pretty fantastic.  I would have never chosen this particular dish on my own, because I just think little lambs are too cuddly and cute to be eaten- however, that night I through all emotional attachment I have to farm animal babies out the window, and I showed that Sunday Gravy who was boss.

He suggested the mojito for my drink and it was amazing. For my appetizer I ordered the Brussel sprouts (what else, right?) and they were great! Not the best Brussels I've had, but still really good. For my dinner, I ordered the chicken sandwich, again at our servers suggestion, and just like the Brussel sprouts, it wasn't life changing, but I liked it and of course cleared my plate (no sense in being wasteful, after all!). \n\nWe definitely enjoyed our evening at Urban Tap and I'm already looking forward to our next visit :)", "business_id": "1HfkEkNhI6XJXkgrCTBKpw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-08-11", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "8Az_JgEpXqAii_5EDkw2tw", "review_id": "jLAw4IjSEOYch-ih89PwZw", "text": "We tried Wingharts for the first time a couple of days ago and loved it!  This was the first time Ive been to any Wingharts location, and I'll definitely be going back.

Ive said in one of my previous reviews that I'm not much of a burger fan, which is still true, but when you try a place thats known for their burgers, I feel like you have to at least try one once.. and I was happy I did!  In my opinion, this place takes priority over Primanti's and Sharp Edge.. yes I said it.  The fries are great and I LOVE that everything is fresh and made in house.. seriously an A+ move in my book.  \n\nOur Bartender, Rick, was awesome.  He gave us some honest suggestions when we inquired about menu items, and he clearly knew his stuff.  He was super friendly and gave us awesome service.  When we first came in and sat down, he said to us \"I've never seen you guys here before, are you new to the area?\".. SERIOUSLY LOVED THAT.  We'll definitely be going back to sit at the bar, if for no other reason than because this guy was on point, and we loved it.  \n\nThe only thing that was disappointing to me was that there were no signature whiskey drinks or specials.. They advertise that they're a Burger and Whiskey Bar, but there's absolutely nothing that draws me in to order any kind of whiskey drink.  I asked if they have any specialty drinks, and all of them were Vodka based drinks.. in a whiskey bar?  Didn't like that, but it didn't bother me enough to give them less than 5 stars and to keep me from going back.

This was the first stop on our adventure.  \nWhen we arrived at this quaint and inviting establishment we were greeted with a smile and asked where we might like to sit.  The outdoor seating looked nice but since it was the middle of summer we went to one of the indoor areas.  We got the iced tea and the cheese plate to start.  It was a small cheese plate but it was perfect for 2 people to share.  The breads and cheeses were a great combination with the dried fruits and nuts.  I know that jams and honey are sometimes a part of the cheese plate picture but this was a small light taster to start.  The way we lunch is we both order an entree and then split it.  Today We order the Signature Strawberry Chicken Salad and the California Club, minus the avocado stupid allergies.  We informed the waitress that we would be splitting them so when they came out they were already split for us.  The first bite of the salad with that poppyseed dressing was so amazing that we both almost forgot about the rest of the food on our plates.  My salad was close to the potato salad so I accidentally got a taste and remember the rest of the food.  The potato salad is hardy and rich without being to mustardy.  It has bacon but it is not too overpowering and somehow still feels a little lite.  They had forgotten to take the avocado off so they immediately took it back and remade the sandwich.  I loved that you could tell that it was a new sandwich since some places take it back and try to scrape the avocado off when they forget.  They never get it all and so the benadryl comes out but I had no reaction.  The bread was this warm focaccia bread that I could have eaten all day.  The turkey was fresh, not slimy, with crisp bacon.  The meal ended up being too much for one sitting so we both had lunch for the next day.  We ended with the Red Velvet cake which came out looking so cute and tasting divine.  We have already talked about going back and refer people here quite frequently.

Do yourself a favor and don't walk in - you likely won't get a table.  Even on a Tuesday, at 6PM.  They're likely booked to 11 by then.  Reserve your table a day or so in advance and get in your 2 guaranteed hours of amazing food and intimate setting.\n\nThis time, we once again ordered the Agedashi Tofu, because... you can't NOT order it.  Even if you don't like tofu, you will love this dish.\n\nA special we tried this time were the small fresh crabs, lightly fried and served posed on a small long dish, as if they're in a little procession of deliciousness... right into your mouth.  They're maybe each as big as a 50 cent piece.  You pop the entire thing into your mouth and chew.  In a word - amazing.  I'm not a big crab lover, but these were tasty, well seasoned, and delicious.  The shell on them is so light there's no worry of impaling your mouth with a piece of them.  My wife devoured them and we almost ordered seconds.  She talked about them on the way home.  The next day.  Just order them if they're available.\n\nThe core dishes that we re-visited from our previous trips are still excellent.  This time we also got 3 sake tasting special to sample with the meal and I was impressed not only with the choices (a filtered, an unfiltered, and a flavored one) but how inexpensive it was for the sampler ($14).  A good value and more than enough to keep a great mood through your meal.\n\nAs an update to my last post, I must say that Raku's desserts are quite excellent.  We've tried the different sorbets, the melty chocolate cake, the bubbly milk pudding, and they've all been wonderful.  Now if they only offered a Honey Toast dessert....\n\nRaku is continuing proof of a growing array of excellent restaurants that you don't have to walk through a casino to find here in Vegas.

The service and management show no concern for their customers or their reputation. Ambivalence doesn't begin to describe the lack of customer focus at this very expensive restaurant. This is a warning. Find another nice restaurant choice.\n\nThe Setting: 8 adults, 40th birthday celebration, 7:45 PM, Saturday night, reservation. Restaurant was about half full (odd on a Saturday night - may be a sign of decline)\n\nThe Food: The plates, from start to finish, were full of flavor, perfectly prepared, and well presented. Not really worth the price as nearby competing restaurants offer better value but definitely a treat. Everyone liked their entrees, especially the one remaining plate of venison (apparently what was available was not worth serving they said. Odd!). Drinks were good and imaginative.\n\nThe Service: Colossally incompetent would not sum it up sufficiently. From the start, at the small bar, of which it was just our party, we had to hail the bartender to get service even as we were the only ones standing there. At the table we were greeted relatively promptly and the menu explained. The \"snacks\" would come more or less immediately and would hold us over until appetizers came out. So we ordered two \"snacks\" and one appetizer.  - - - - Twenty-two minutes later, after we had finished a bottle of wine and several water glasses were empty for some time, we got up and found the waiter to ask where they were. He said \"two minutes more\". Eight minutes later (now a full 30 minutes) our immediate \"snacks\" arrived. The appetizer came 5 minutes later (now 35 minutes! - that was the only plate taken from the bill). They were good. Water glasses filled again. NOT A WORD was said in apology or acknowledgement. Now, after nearly 40 minutes, we actually ordered our entrees. WTF!? \n\nWe have seen the waiter maybe twice and the manager once as he told us (15 minutes after we ordered) that only one venison plate was worthy of serving. Order something else.\n\nHere we are, seated about about 8pm. At 9:25 the entrees arrived. They were fabulous. One of our party had to get his in a \"to go bag\" as he had not planned on a two hour dinner. None of us had.\n\nEnd Result: While the manager did bring a plate of lovely truffles for the birthday girl (thank you) not a word, no apology, no mention whatsoever of the tremendously poor service and ridiculously long wait times (and again, the restaurant was full of empty tables). Nothing but the one appetizer was provided in compensation. The manager never even came to apologize and address the concerns that we voiced, relatively politely at first, throughout the \"ordeal\".", "business_id": "bgvm73MMjC2f5qo_RgXOXg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-01-20", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "HMVnmO02JBwkIAiwkKIg0A", "review_id": "UCOB5-ti9T749qbyG0BJuA", "text": "I wanted a change to my hair as I have had it very lengthy for so long.

Completely underground and secluded from the chaotic world above.  We had a drink and went on our way to Richardson's next door which was also amazing, but that's a whole other review.  My second experience was when my best friend and I planned our birthday dinner with our guys.  She made our reservations and requested one of the booths, which we were accomodated with.  Our server was great, she was friendly and very attentive.  We ordered chicken skewers as our appetizer, I had the chicken schnitzel, my best friend had the pork adobada, and the guys both ordered the prime rib.  All were delicious!  The prime ribs were huge!  We had a great time.  It's a quiet lil hole in the wall bar/restaurant.  Great for catching up with a friend over drinks or a date night!

The business owner (Sherene) has been EXTREMELY difficult to get ahold of, and once we were able to speak to her, she was incredibly rude and less than accommodating.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 tried to purchase a gift certificate for me on Mother's Day (which is advertised on her website) to have my eyebrows microbladed. It says on the website that she accepted PayPal, MasterCard, & Visa as payment. When my fianc\u00e9 called to purchase the gift certificate, Sherene INSISTED she would only take payment from him in cash, which was weird not only because we knew services would not be rendered immediately (as I pregnant and she would not perform microblading on pregnant or breastfeeding women. I was looking forward to the experience after pregnancy) but also because we lived 60 miles from the studio. She told us to come pick up the certificate and that she would have \"Danica\" re-write it because we \"took too long to pick up the first one\"(After stating it would be a week or so before we could make it to Scottsdale).\n\nAfter several attempts to pay for and receive the gift certificate, on not only my fianc\u00e9's part, but mine as well (her excuse was that she was very busy and the BEST around), I finally went in to the \"studio\" which was very hidden and hard to find. The door was locked and there was a sign that directed you to a different building if you were looking for Sherene. I knocked on the door and it was answered by a woman wearing a necklace that said \"Danica\". She informed me that Sherene was out of the office, actually stating that she was \"on the ocean somewhere\" and had me write down my fianc\u00e9 and I's contact information (on the back of a random envelope) to get back to us. When I told \"Danica\" that she was the one that was supposed to have my gift certificate, she blew me off saying she was with a client and that there were TWO Danica's that worked there, so it must have been the other one who had the gift certificate.\n\nThen tonight at 10:45pm Sherene called my fianc\u00e9 and said that our business was too much of a hassle for her, and due to \"good business practices\" she was not going to perform the services for me. Once they were off the phone, she text messaged him and said she had recorded the phone call without him knowing, so I had my attorney call her and she questioned him as to why he was phoning her at 11:00 at night and then hung up on him.\n\nThis place has been a nightmare and a hassle from the start, and I would't recommend this place to anybody. The staff, ESPECIALLY, the owner Sherene, are all rude and run their business in a very nonprofessional manner. I am writing this review in an attempt to save anyone the hassle and hours I spent trying to deal with this business.

One was a white pizza with arrugula, the other was a spicy sauce pizza with sopprasatta salalmi. I knew something was not right when not even 5 minutes later the spicy pizza shows up. Its a super thin crust, a little to thin IMO. The outside crust was crispy and cooked well, but the inside of the pizza was a soggy uncooked mess! You could not pick it up, if you wanted to. The arrugula pizza was just plain weird. Just picture a white pizza crust and dumping a large bowl of raw arrugula on top.WTF?? I've had my share of good authentic wood oven pizzas before.

Needless to say we ended up needing him and he came in like our white knight! Right from the get go you could tell that Buck's main mission was to truly help us out and shoot some fantastic photos along the way.  Day of the ceremony Buck was on time if not early and shot with us throughout the duration of the day. He was a perfect director and commanded the crowd of bridesmaids and groomsmen while managing to joke around and make us feel at ease at the same time. We received countless compliments on Buck's demeanor and preparedness throughout the whole day! The morning after the wedding we were blown away that Buck had already managed to send us about 25 edited photos as a sneak peak to tide us over and BOY were they incredible. I'm so in love with them and I haven't even seen them all! I would recommend Buck to anyone and can't wait to find another reason to get some photos taken!!", "business_id": "w3Z7SjtrFcGZAP7s-KdVqg", "stars": 5, "date": "2017-03-30", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "hCC1SQK5ux51EkmAppCsJQ", "review_id": "JXTqFtgmYcGWQq-SuCk9Lw", "text": "This was a great Yelp Find!

The horchata was milky, had a nutty taste and a hint of cinnamon.

There were nice chunks of fish in the taco and they were cooked perfectly, not oily and it didn't have too much batter either. Though the fish was a bit too salty for my taste, the spicy signature sauce overpowered the dish but that's why there were fresh pico de gallo and lemon juice to help\n\n-Al Pastor Taco (Pork meat marinated in the traditional sauce, served on corn tortillas with pineapple, coriander and onion) - $9.75\nYou get 5 tacos for $10 which I think was a great value! Unfortunately the pork was really dry and bland so I inquired the server, which resulted into me receiving a glare from her and she dropped (literally dropped) the new order onto our table without saying anything.

Unlike other versions of deep fried chicken, karaage is not greasy and will not make you feel gross or drowned in oil afterwards. The chicken karaage at gushi achieved just that, it was juicy with a crispy-light surface, while still remained succulent when cold.\n\nThe purple rice was alright, I found it to be cold and hard to eat :(. The rice can be bland for some people, however the karaage had a right amount of salt in the seasonings, with a hint of spiciness from the mayo sauce, when eaten in one bite it was a delicious combination! Although they didn't give me any lemon wedges, there was some ginger to refresh your palate so I can forgive that! :p\n\n*Gushi Chicken Skewer - $6: \nThe skewer was longer than an iPhone 6 Plus! (Yes sorry for the weird comparison, but I can't think of any other object to compare to lol).\n\nAgain, the skewer was juicy and delicious!

The lobster miso soup was packed with lobster essence, and the broth was clear and incredibly light. The ebi nanban (shrimp) and Ika Karamari (calamari) had a light breading with a tart sauce on the side. The tai kama - grilled sea bream was tender and mildly seasoned to showcase its natural flavor.

These were cooked perfectly, super moist, flavourful and coated with a delicious spicy gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste) sauce. The sauce was light, just a bit sweet, and right level of spiciness.

The pho burger had all the toppings of a pho noodle soup (without the noodles of course) - bean sprouts, basil, sriracha and hoisin sauce was not necessary since I'm Northern Viet but it's alright to have it :).

In addition, they offer macarons and pretty little cakes - like Mont Blanc, lemon tart.\n\nMy orders: \n-Lemon Tart: was very refreshing and the acidity level was just right!. The ratio of the shortbread crust to lemon curd was perfect. In my opinion, if you are looking for something that is not as sweet as the Pistache, the lemon tart is a great option!\n\n-Pistache: was a little too sweet for my likings. The crust was flaky and adds a great crunchy texture to the pistachio filling. In my opinion the pistachio filling was a bit too creamy and the pistachio flavor was very subtle, I wish the flavor was a bit stronger. That being said, there are some layers of hidden raspberry jam between the pistachio cream and it really helps cut down the creaminess of the pistachio.\n\n-Macarons (Earl Grey, Oolong, Green tea): The texture of these macarons was good. The Matcha and Oolong flavors really came through, except for the Earl Grey. They were a tad too sweet in my opinion, it was too much that I had to drink water or tea to wash down the sweetness in my throat..\n\n-The 8: my favourite!

The cotton candy didn't feel fresh as it was really sticky, but I can understand that since making fresh cotton candy for every order wasn't efficient.

BACON NATION - Bacon wrapped grilled cheese - $12.85: \nFor $12.85 the grilled cheese was pretty small. Surprisingly it was amazingly delicious and it was one of the best item we had that day. Bacon was not too dry nor too crispy, and the cheese itself was still warm and melted nicely so it wasn't an explosive mess when I took a bite. The bacon was salty but there was no seasoning on the bread and cheese, so the sandwich itself had a right amount of saltiness. The grilled cheese also came with a chipotle ketchup sauce, which gave a nice hint of spicy and smokiness to the sandwich.\n\n2.

The fries were crunchy on the outside, soft inside with just a slightly melted shredded cheese on top. Polenta itself can be bland, but these were salted just right with a delicious and tangy tomato sauce!\n\n-Tuna Tartare - $9:\nThe tuna tartare was placed on top of a black pepper crisp, topped with crema, mint and pickled chilies. I didn't enjoy this dish as I felt the pickled chilies were so spicy that it prevented me from tasting the fresh tuna. The crema nor mint didn't help to ease the spiciness either, overall a very disappointing dish.\n\n-Duo of Pork: Pork headcheese & pork loin - $25: \nThe duo of pork consisted of panko crusted then deep fried pork head cheese and roasted pork loin; topped with pine nut, yogurt and all of this deliciousness sat on top of a tomato chickpeas ragu and roasted sweet potato. For those who don't know, head cheese is essentially a sausage or bologna made out of boiled pig head. I have had parts of the pork head in the past, however this was my first time to have the ENTIRE pork head. To be honest it had a standard pork flavors and texture, so don't be afraid! Also, these were panko crusted and deep fried, and as I always say, deep fry makes everything taste better! The pork loin was juicy, the ragu was hearty and amazing, however I found the sweet potato was a bit undercooked. Though the yogurt sauce might sound strange, the tanginess really helped to cut down the dish as it was quite heavy\n\n-Sweet Potato & Cheddar Perogies - $23: \nAnother must oder at Richmond Station! The perogies were soft and the seared crust added some texture and eliminated the stickiness. They were filled with cheddar and sweet potato, a bit on the heavy side but the accompanying beet puree and and tangy sour cream lightened up the meal. The caramelized onions, fennels and sauteed swiss chard paired well and helped to balance the dish. With that said, I didn't quite get the flavor of the cinnamon cap mushroom", "business_id": "mZRKH9ngRY92bI_irrHq6w", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-09-14", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "xYciRtVZ1PW4IxSX4oJ1aw", "review_id": "fhur3UyBQl5C7mev1XxePA", "text": "Beware, this place fills up really fast, it is ideal to come here early as they don't take reservations. They have added the stamp card now. I can't remember what the rewards were, so I can't comment whether the stamp card is worth it or not.\n\n-Roasted Ox Tongue - $5.99: The ox tongue itself was a bit dry, and it didn't taste like it was roasted or BBQ. I felt like they reheated it in the microwave, and put some sauce and peanuts on top. The sauce was overly sweet for a savory dish, and I believe the sweetness came from honey? It was nothing special and I don't recommend this dish at all.\n\n-Supreme Beef Teppan Yaki Rice - $8.99: I recommend to cook the beef slices upon its arrival and mix the ingredients, as my friend once got raw beef because he mixed the ingredients first before letting the beef cook fully. The sauce itself is inside the rice, and it's like a teriyaki black pepper sauce. The sauce was a bit sweet with a kick of spiciness throughout the dish, but I would have like to have some more salt as I felt the dish itself was a bit bland\n\n-Shrimp Teppan Pasta with Numbing sauce - $10.50: The pasta dishes are really oily. I think they put more oil in pasta than usual to stop the noodles from overcooking and dry up too fast? The shrimps were already pre-cooked and were not bland. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the dish and it wasn't as spicy as I expected. I remember the Tom Yum sauce was spicier so be careful!\n\n-House special chicken with cream sauce Pasta - $9.50: Same as above. It's oily but the chicken was tender and flavorful, I definitely think this is much better than the beef. With that said, I don't recommend the cream sauce as it was bland and very light. \n\n-Traditional Herbal Hot Pot with Strip Loin set - $14.99: It's quite expensive for 5 pieces of meat, but my friend enjoyed it and she was quite full afterwards. \n\n-Baked Cheese Japanese Rice Cake - $5.99:  I can't remember exactly how it tastes, but I remember enjoying it. The rice cake was a bit salty and it's a very filling dish.\n\n-Original Tiramisu - $5.99: The chocolate crumbles on top is like soil with a mini plant in a small clay pot. The portion was quite small for $6 and it didn't have the coffee and cream flavors of a tiramisu, quite disappointing. In my opinion, order this for the cute presentation (and a worthy instagram picture) but don't expect too much.\n\n*Complain: The service is not very consistent. I remember having rude servers for one of my visit, whereas other time the servers were very nice and attentive. In addition, I remember they used to accept debit and credit, I don't understand why they only accept cash now. It's quite annoying that they don't accept other type of payments as the bill can get quite high (an average of $40 - $50 for 2 to 3 people respectively).", "business_id": "moZAQFO776KIBe38WjiTJw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-19", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "xYciRtVZ1PW4IxSX4oJ1aw", "review_id": "Gwqjua-pBoL3X0ub3WksNA", "text": "Have you ever really wanted to like a restaurant and even questioned your taste palate, because of the rave reviews from Yelp and your friends? Sadly Eat Fresh Be Healthy is one of those restaurants. As far as I recall, that day I kept tasting and tried to analyze the flavours of each plate, simply because I thought there was something wrong with my taste buds. \n\nAltogether it was an okay meal, not spectacular or awful. The presentation was a miss, but the flavors of all the dishes were done well, just the execution and final touches were not there. The portion was generous for the price that I paid for, and service was top-notch.\n\n-Caesar Salad garnish with Crispy Blue Crab: My friend ended up pouring the salad onto the plate, because the mug was so inconvenient when you try to reach for the salad at the bottom. The crab was just there for presentation, and there was barely any meat in it. The caesar salad was good though, the dressing was light, seasoned nicely with just the right amount of cheese.\n\n-Crispy Calamari serves with Scallion Yogurt: the sauce on the plate made the dish look messy and greasy. The chef also put the sauce in a shot glass, which was located in the middle of the calamari and it was delicious! But why put it in the shot glass?! The calamari was perfectly crispy and seasoned, despite the odd pairing of the yogurt sauce and calamari, I liked the combination! The yogurt dip was refreshing and balanced the fatty deep fried calamari.\n\n-Ontario Braised Leg of Lamb: My friend and I both got leg of lamb as our main and we were disappointed. First, we expected to get an actual leg of lamb, instead we received two bone pieces covered in sauce. The vegetables were lightly steamed, but too undercooked and under-seasoned for us to try. The mashed potatoes were okay...not memorable. The star of this dish, the \"leg\" of lamb was a tad overcooked, which resulted in dry and tough pieces of meat. Having said that, the sauce was flavorful and aromatic, I wish they served some bread on the side to dip in all that delicious sauce.\n\n-Double Espresso Panna Cotta: The texture was creamy and smooth, a bit too \"wobbly\" for me, but the sweetness was perfect with the rich espresso flavour, a very delightful dessert. The \"soup\" was a coconut-based soup I believe, with some pomegranate here and there.\n\n-Lindt Chocolate Ice-Cream: friend said the texture of the ice cream is more of a soft-serve, and it wasn't anything special.", "business_id": "nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-05-13", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "xYciRtVZ1PW4IxSX4oJ1aw", "review_id": "ppyusnhFOqQmmusZoNieHw", "text": "*Sukho Thai is sorta the more upscale version of Pai, which is actually their sister restaurant! \n*The prices here are definitely higher and the ambiance isn't as casual or street-style like Pai. \n\n-shrimp fresh rolls w/ peanut sauce - $8\nI liked how well crafted the rolls were, I mean, don't you hate it when the rolls fall apart while eating?! I would have liked it more if the vegetables were pickled or there were more seasonings on the shrimp to add more flavors, or more heat in the peanut sauce would be even better!\n\n-sukhoTHAI mango salad - $6\nI was fairly disappointed with the mango salad from Sukho Thai. The mango was soggy and limp, and it was too sour as well. The salad didn't have the balance between the sweetness and acidity of the lime juice, nor did it have any heat from the chilies.\n\n-gaeng kiaw wan(beef green curry w/ bamboo shoots, Thai basil, green peppers) - $14\nThe beef pieces were very tender and soaked up all the curry flavors. However the curry arrived lukewarm, the consistency was quite watery and in term of taste, it was not as flavorful as the one in Pai. There was less curry paste and there should be a bit more coconut milk to add a nice touch of sweetness. I was also surprised to see how mild this dish was! In general green curry is the spiciest out of all the curries (Red is second then Yellow), and I ordered spicy so they seriously toned down the heat of this a lot.\n\n-Thai fried rice - $13.50\nMy friend said it was just a typical fried rice, nothing special.", "business_id": "vh1tPEaPioD78QmoqnWXpw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-12-23", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "xYciRtVZ1PW4IxSX4oJ1aw", "review_id": "yjtAdq3Wq8EPnREIIDa9LQ", "text": "3.5/5. \n*The restaurant is gorgeous and perfect for a date night. \n*Some of the dishes really needed some final touches to make them perfect.\n*A bit expensive for the portion that we received. \n*Our server was friendly however she was pretty much overworked. The host was there just to look pretty and didn't bother to even check for our desserts when we asked (it arrived 45 minutes late!!!). \n\n-Pappardelle Pasta (Lamb ragu, sweet peas, tomatoes, mint) - $16: \nThe pappardelle was slightly under-cooked for both of us and I wished there was more sauce as the lamb ragu was just perfect!! Very hearty with melted-in-your-mouth lamb pieces and seasoned perfectly, my favorite!\n\n-Bavette (?) nero scoglio (Scallop, squid, clams, mussels) - $26: \nOn the menu this dish was actually made with fettucine pasta, however it was sold out that day so the server offered me a different type of pasta. \n\nFor $26 the portion was quite small, however the pasta was al dente and you can tell Via Vai make their own pasta in house! There were a decent amount of seafood for $26 and they were cooked perfectly. However the tomato sauce was lacking in flavor and the whole dish was bland, so it was quite disappointing as I was really looking forward to this dish :(.\n\n-Honey Panna Cotta - $7: \nIt was pretty good. The panna cotta had the right texture and the tangy fruits helped to cut down the sweetness from the honey.\n\n-Tiramisu - $7:\nI didn't like the biscotti as it was dry and tough to eat. The tiramisu had a strong espresso and chocolate flavor and the taste was just pure heaven. Surprisingly the base of the tiramisu was a sponge cake instead of lady fingers, which I didn't mind as I found the tiramisu still held up really well. I also liked how there wasn't too much mascarpone so the dessert wasn't too rich nor sweet, and I didn't think the raspberry sauce was needed", "business_id": "G3rk0dDROzpDdTugsnSDTw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-10-09", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "xYciRtVZ1PW4IxSX4oJ1aw", "review_id": "5WnM7ZbiexxulHHGvSYQjw", "text": "*I got a $50 gift card so part of this meal was paid by someone else :)\n*my friend and I ended up ordering $100 worth of dishes and drinks as toward the end of the meal, we realized $50 was just simply not enough to fill up both of us.\n*Servers were good except for manager who gave us an attitude, because we were using a gift card. \n\n-Red Tuna Sashimi with Salted Wasabi Pesto - $13: \nThe tuna was placed inside a tube made out of daikon radish, and the flower-shaped radish resembled the falling sakura flowers. Despite the artsy presentation, I thought this dish was a bit too expensive for $13 as you are only getting a few chopped pieces of tuna here. I liked how the salted wasabi pesto had enough spicy kick without the heat linger in your mouth. However I couldn't really taste the raspberry balsamic soy vinaigrette as I felt there were too much raw red onions compares to the sashimi, thus I couldn't taste the flavors of the tuna.\n\n-PEI Oysters topped with Yuzu Jelly - $9 for 3: \nVery good, sweet PEI oysters with a slight tangy yuzu jelly to brighten up the freshness of the oyster. \n\n-Kobe Beef Tartar - $15: \nI highly recommend this dish! The portion was generous for $15 and it would have been better if they offered more crostini or different type of bread! My teeth constantly felt like it's going to break soon everytime I took a bite :(. I liked how the fresh scallion puree and garlic confit aioli added just enough flavors while still letting the natural flavors of the beef tartare to shine through. It was not spicy nor too salty, just seasoned perfectly with some crunchy texture from the crispy rice \n\n-Kobe Beef Steak - $23: \nAgain the portion was a bit small for $23 but it was another dish that both of us really enjoyed. The steak was perfect medium rare and melted in your mouth goodness. The garlic oil and pickled onions gave a hint of spiciness and the sweet(!) soy sauce was just right without overpowering the natural taste of the kobe beef. That bright orange puree is smoked carrot and I wished there was more, it was aromatic, smooth and comforting, yummy!\n\n-Mini Shio Ramen - $7\nThe noodle bowl came out piping hot with a smooth and superb flavorful broth. With that said, it was quite bland and I felt the broth might be too fatty for some people. Noodles were cooked to perfection and I was surprised to see thin noodles (which is what I prefer anyways), and there wasn't an option to choose thicker noodles so I guess this is how Okinawa ramen is supposed to be?  The cha siu was buttery soft and melted in your mouth, but I would have appreciate it if there was more meat compare to fat and a bit more charred on the pork belly.", "business_id": "ryyptYnhb8n94NnEF_MRnQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-10-28", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "sscuQ5qeAWAi40EE_O0MNA", "review_id": "UnHoLsTouS801xB7GpyCeA", "text": "My go to place for  takeout Mexican.

Decades? Since my parents' childhood days. I've been here numerous times as a kid up until now. It's no disneyland or six flags for that matter.. But it's a classic? It's the only thing in Pennsylvania I guess ? I mean, it's got a few good roller coasters, and many rides for the kids like swings or bumper cars. The only thing that makes kennywood truly stand out is a few select rides and the novelty of its history. If you're an out-of-towner, I really recommend he spooky \"Noah's ark\". I've never seen anything like this at any amusement park or fair, etc. I used to be terrified of this ride as a kid, but now it's just interesting. The talking lion trash can is also my favorite. Don't forget the creepy laughing lady by the train. Don't get me wrong, Kenny wood is cool and all, but when you travel the world at other amusement parks , you realize how much it's lacking. The park is usually clean, but the restrooms should be a hazard tbh. There are also a few water rides worth mentioning. The log one is amazing. When you get down that ramp, you're just surrounded by a stunning wall of water for a split second. It feels like you're frozen in time. Then BOOM you're soaked. Even those watching from afar can get quite soaked from just standing nearby. The phantoms revenge is the only \"new\"coaster but not much else. It hurts my back honestly. It's so jolty, not a smooth ride at all. Not nearly as thrilling as six flags. (You're all missing out). The aero 360 is pretty good too, and can be found in most amusement parks.  There are also prize winning games, parades, train rides, and lots of food. Overall, I recommend coming here for the one time experience or if you have nothing else to do.

Maybe some signs of wear and tear on the shower. Spacious closet with a lockable safe. Dual sinks in bathroom. Toilet door separate from the tub and shower. \nThe TV is a little old but nice.  \n\nThe casino is good, but some slot machines were out of service. The drinks were good.

The oyster rockafeller, 2x baked potato & creamed spinach was delicious though. The \"special garlic bread\" was soooo lame though! 3 pieces for $5! It was basically texas toast! After reading reviews from others, I wanted to also mention that they also double charged us for the \"special garlic bread\" with 2 orders when we only ordered 1 and it was over-priced to begin with and dry.\n\nTo top off the night, the waiter had the audacity to ask me if we were using a GROUPON when giving us our check (keep in mind I had to ask for it because of the crappy service)!

A wedding party was taking photos in the main pub/dining area, so we were seated in the side room, which was fine. Just one other table occupied. \n\nI ordered the Irish stew (because the steak pie could not be made without Stilton since it was pre-made, and I dislike Stilton). It arrived and looked like a bowl of watered-down gravy. I could not see any chunks of meat or vegetables at all, just a smooth liquid surface in the bowl. Dipping my spoon in, I did find 3, 1-inch chunks of meat, a few potato chunks, and carrots cut so large I needed to use my knife to eat them. Flavour was fine, but this was a scant soup, not a rich and hearty Irish stew! It was nothing like the stew photo I see posted by yelper Teresa Y!\n\nMy date ordered the fish and chips. The fries were cold, and the two pieces of fish were the exact same size and shape - definitely not battered in-house - and they were wrapped in a green paper wrap with a glossy newspaper insert rather than a piece of newspaper. They were going for authenticity, but really failed. No tartar sauce was provided, either.\n\nNeedless to say, a very disappointing meal.

Let's put that into perspective.  Pittsburgh has a long history of truly terrible fake Mex places at varying price points.  Here's what makes Bea's great in my opinion.  First, the good was just plain tasty.  Can't speak for authenticity, but everything I've tried (various tacos by the each) on our two trips was very good.  Second, the place is just plain cheap.  Like, our total was $21 (before tip) last trip.  This included three tacos, a burrito and a side of beans.  It's shameful to admit this, but that's the same amount we spend for junk at Taco Bell.  Obviously, I prefer to support the local guy using much better quality ingredients...  Service was polite on both trips, though not necessarily impressive.

Guess I've fallen off the foodie scene. \n\nAnyhow, as a Bistro 19 fan, this place did not disappoint.  Of course, the view was amazing and probably worth going just for a drink.  The decor was modern and lovely as well.  A tiny bit tight on space, but not uncomfortably so.   (Side note:  you could easily get seated in the bar area when we arrived at 5:15 and again.  Around 6:30-45, it was completely empty again... This was Saturday night.  So, if you're planning to stop by without a reservation and stay in the bar, it looks like if you do it either early or in the middle of the dinner hour, you're solid.)  \n\nSpeaking of drinks, they were fantastic.  Huz had the East India and I had a French 75. \n\nWe also had the charcuterie, which the husband raved about and he rarely raves.  I was stunned as he kept shoveling meat and cheese into his mouth.  Typically, I end up eating these sorts of plates by myself while he rants about how the restaurant thinks it's fancy... \n\nThe popcorn was truffle flavor.... I don't really care for popcorn, but managed to eat most of it.... Delish and a fun touch.\n\nI also have no idea what they added to the butter ... salt and a seasoning... it was like crack butter....\n\nFor dinner, I had the goose goose duck, which was truly outstanding.  I ate all of it.  And I rarely eat meat.  He had the steak, which didn't do much for me (I'm not much of a steak eater), but he thought it was perfect.  And it was beautifully cooked.\n\nFor dessert, we had chocolate cheesecake.  He thought it was amazing.  Again, not really my thing (or maybe I was just too full?), but tasty enough.  The marinated cherries on the plate were my fave.  Actually, I'd have eaten the cherries and the ice cream alone...  And they sent us with a delightful little fruit cookie bar thing, so we really didn't need to order dessert.\n\nI also had a glass of delish zinfandel (with the duck) and a cappuccino (with dessert).  He had a sparkling water with dinner.  Total bill before tip was around $150.  Completely worth it.  Easily the best meal we've had in ages.  And, frankly, if you had a single drink, still water, and skipped dessert, you could be close to the 50 pp mark.  (Entrees were in the $30 ball park and certainly enough for a meal... )  But, if you're going to splurge, why not?!\n\nAs noted by some of the other reviews, unlike a lot of fine dining places, the portions were very generous.\n\nService was also near perfect.  The server was prompt, polite and helpful.  The sommelier was appropriately present and helpful.  We thought about a bottle and he didn't bat an eyelash when I decided upon just a glass.  The wine list was nicely comprehensive -- a little bit for everyone at a good range of prices.  \n\nIf you've got a special night out coming up, this is the place.  Hands down.

For drinks, he:  bourbon cocktail and a red rye beer (blanking on which); me: gin cocktail (probably the only thing I ordered I'd skip next time), a pinotage (a nice change from the usuals you see), and a flight of amaros (DO THIS!).  Service was very knowledgeable and perhaps over-attentive? Total tab was $125 before tip,which was more than reasonable for what we had.\n\nBottom line:  I loved the experience and the combination of flavors and ideas.  If you're a foodie and enjoy eating as an event, this place is definitely for you.  (Apparently, the mayor agrees... he was seated a few tables down.)  However, if you are a food purist or think too many flavors clutter a plate, you'll think this place is over-priced/over-hyped and might find the portion sizes too small.  (If you think Olive Garden is actually Italian food or would identify a steak joint as your favorite restaurant, I'm looking at you...)  My husband fell into this later category -- he appreciated the execution and thought the dishes were well-done, but the place wouldn't rank on his list of favorites.  He said if we were given a GC and could eat for free, he'd likely have me take my mother (who would enjoy the meal more than he).  \n\nAlso, you certainly do seem to need a res to get into this place even on Sunday early.", "business_id": "bdNyoXY4yJ99derJRqhP3Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-11-02", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "AXJJBEnqAfvU6gYjzCVh9w", "review_id": "3UMbSr-DGFnpoTliDQnj1w", "text": "Wow has this location gone downhill.

But it wasn't even that good.  (Side note: why is the el camp's on McKnight so vastly superior to the other locations?) It was just bland as heck and the service, while pleasant, was really slow.  Despite the place being empty.  Prices were what you'd expect.  On the upside, portions were huge if you're into that type of thing.  Of the three of us who went together, the best thing had was a chicken quesadilla... not a good sign.\n\nFor this type of a joint, I definitely prefer El Paso over in Bridgeville.

The Lightning is one of the best rolls I have had in some time. The rice pudding with peaches and coconut milk was delicious for dessert.

That is because it can be nearly impossible to drop off or pick up people curb side.  Traffic clogs up easily and often.\n\nThere is no Sky Club or partner equivalent.

Apparently flights come only in bunches to LAS.  On that note for those of you without a lot of experience using taxis, be careful, Las Vegas cabbies love to rip you off with the scenic route that they claim will take the same amount of time because it avoids traffic.

If I'm in the area and looking for a buffet, ya. \n\nComparison: \nSelection of entrees comparable to Mandarin and Buffet King. Buffet King has some better dishes though (more seafood). I think they have more desserts at Dragon Pearl than either competitor.\n\nThe long review:\n\nMan, I must be getting old.  Once up a time, in a town not so far away, a skinny Asian boy was able to pound down plate after plate of food and desserts.  \n\nThat was then, this is now. My metabolism no longer allows me to do this, and my stomach physically hurts after chowing down more than 3 plates of food.\n\nAs a result, even at buffets, I look for quality and quantity in more cases than naught, and even in buffets I can't turn a blind eye to the quality.  The food here was average, though they had a large selection.  I can't say anything was particularly \"good\", but everything was ok, I think the lower turn over on a Tuesday night might have contributed. Maybe it's better for lunch, I hear it's rammed so the dishes are likely fresher.\n\nWith a carving station (roast beef), grill station (kalbi ribs, chicken, fish, grilled bananas and sweet potatoes), sushi section (including salmon and white fish sashimi and rolls), and plenty of hot plates of Asian food (peking duck, your pseudo american-chinese chicken balls) including chinese and japanese inspired dishes, pizza, BBQ ribs, there's definitely a lot of selection here. I'd say more selection than Mandarin and Buffet King.  \n\nAs for quality, the roast beef was a bit cold and slightly dry, but how many buffets outside of Nevada have good roast beef? The peking duck was mediocre and the bread that comes with it was too large, a bit thick and dry, but how many buffets have peking duck? The sushi selection was better than Mandarin and I think better than buffet king.  The BBQ ribs were actually quite good and along with their noodle station,  I'd say my favorite thing available.  The salmon was overcooked and dry.  I won't go on, but the quality was on par with Mandarin, but Buffet King has better entrees and better quality food.\n\nThe dessert station was large as well, with a good assortment of cakes, cookies, pies, waffles, ice cream, etc.  Quality of the desserts was on par with Mandarin. \n\nAll in all, it's not bad, and if you're closer to Dragon Pearl than Mandarin, it's not worth the extra drive to Mandarin.", "business_id": "cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-05-04", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "XuCbLgo9j1q5dDh9251vkg", "review_id": "d7zqTU2Us1-1vmdz7aPb5g", "text": "Nice location downtown, good pour over coffee, WiFi, your typical clean hipster coffee stop.

The ceremony was very brief (about 10 minutes), but that is exactly what we wanted since my now husband does not like being in the spotlight for too long. All of our friends and family continue to tell us how beautiful the chapel and ceremony were. We had two limos, and they both came on time and both drivers were very friendly. We actually hired a different limo company to take us to our reception, and they were horrible and rude. Our entire wedding party kept commenting on how they wish our limo drivers from Vegas Weddings were able to take us to our reception instead of the other company we hired. (Our venue was too far.) We received our ceremony DVD, photo slideshow, and all photos the very next day... Such a quick turn around and we love all of the photos and video! Also, I went back and forth on adding the all-inclusive photo package since it cost more than the entire ceremony itself. I do not regret it! We received 311 photos and love all of them.

From the very first contact with Heather, I knew we picked the perfect place for our wedding. Heather was super responsive, professional, knowledgeable and helped us have the perfect reception. You can really tell her family loves what they do. They made planning from San Diego very easy, and I wasn't even worried that I had never had a chance to visit the venue or do any food or cake tastings. I was able to visit the venue the day before the reception to drop off a few decor items, and I was blown away. Pictures do not do it justice. I loved everything about it. My now husband and I are kind of foodies and have worked in the restaurant industry in the past, so we can be picky about food and cake. I was worried about that. But everyone raved about the food and cake! We got the Parmesan crusted chicken with chive and sour cream sauce, and everyone loved it! Jeff, the DJ, kept everyone on the dance floor all night. The bartender was great too. The venue is oddly located in a shopping center and about 20 minutes from the strip (so maybe a bit far for some), but I would highly recommend this for a bride and groom who are looking to save money but still throw a great party with open bar, good food, and fun music. I was a bride who didn't care about little details like dramatic floral centerpieces that people will forget a few days later. Many of my friends have recently gotten married and I know you cannot beat the price we paid. All of our guests had an amazing time. We all wish we could do it all over again!

Looking on Google for \"things to do in Pittsburgh\"/\"what to not miss in Pittsburgh\" we saw that Primanti Brothers was on the list, so we decided that we should experience the wonder of the Primanti sandwiches.\n\nPrimanti Brothers is open 24 hours a day and has a small parking lot attached for customer parking.  If you get there after 6pm street parking is open, so you should have several options.  The restaurant is a lot of fun to look at.  You can tell it has been around for a long time (80 years).  The walls are covered in framed newspaper articles reviewing the restaurant, pictures of celebrities at the restaurant, and t-shirts that say \"Bite Me...Primanti Brothers.\"  They are a cash only facility, but there is an ATM in the front in case you don't have any cash on you.  The kitchen is open and you can sit in that room or the attached room where the bar is located.  The restaurant can be compared to an old diner or sandwich shop where you can find the menu on a placard on the wall.\n\nAll but three of the sandwiches are meat heavy.  If you are not a meat eater then you may choose one of two fish sandwiches, an egg sandwich, or a cheese sandwich.  All sandwiches come with a heaping helping of fries, cole slaw, and tomato piled on top of your sandwich filling choice, and stuffed in between two thick pieces of white bread.\n\nI split a cheese deluxe sandwich with my girlfriend.  She really enjoyed her half of the sandwich, complimenting the cook for getting the greasiness of the fries just perfect.  I was not as pleased with my half.  I enjoyed the cole slaw, it added a bit of tang and tart crispness to a rather dull sandwich.  They were not at all generous with the amount of cheese in the sandwich, the bread was quite tasteless, and the fries were soggy and flavorless.  I added some salt to the fries and that made a world of difference, but I still wasn't a fan.  \n\nI'm glad I went to the restaurant and experienced this Pittsburgh staple but I  could  have skipped it and that would have been fine too.

So he ordered the truffled brioche and asparagus toast with fontina and egg which sounded great. And the food even looks really appetizing. Photo worthy for sure. But the food was soo bland. Neither of us could taste the truffle, and I love sweet and savory together but the brioche in this dish did not work. I ordered the brie and apple omelette off the healthy side of the menu which I expected to not taste as good as something more decadent but the eggs were so flavorless.  It seemed like there wasn't any brie inside the omelette, only one big piece on top. I also requested spinach be added, which it wasn't. I didn't want to wait for a new omelette so I asked for a side of vegetables which he declined to accommodate. We did not make very big dents in either of our dishes (which a good server should notice) but ours was completely oblivious to almost everything. He wasn't rude but needs a serious wake up call.

It was not the warm butter toasted goodness to which I have become accustomed or that was displayed in the ad. I also ordered squash it was sort of like a warm salad because it was totally raw. Not a little firm, just raw. My two year old joined me and she was presented with what had to be the worse looking Mac and cheese in the history of Mac and cheese. I am a little exhausted by the stuff that passes for food in this city.

Basically this is corporate America - hiring idiots who can't deliver simple requests like a decent salad that doesn't look like a small Hamster portion with shredded and soggy lettuce and chopped tomato!  Looks like one of those prepackaged salads at McDonalds.  Sorry, I requested actual sliced tomato, avocado and red onion and real lettuce but the dumb server screwed it up.  Let alone I order a charbroiled steak (not fried) and they only charbroiled one side with that facing up (as if I would'nt notice).  When I sent back the salad without eating it this manager - a little \"piss ant\" bald jerk comes running out and tells me to leave the restaurant and not come back!  About a month before that the lot was entirely full without one space so I parked my car in the take out area and this little creep Morrison comes running up to the bar threatening to tow me!  When I complained to Corporate Management they actually defended him!  It must be difficult to find decent employees with the crappy wages they pay.  So much for getting repeat business - they could care less.  Better to hire twenty bad employees and pay them crap than hire five good ones and pay them fairly.  That's why their turnover is so high.  Steer clear of this place is my advice.", "business_id": "uI-dbKk_9cUen7pi3-16Sg", "stars": 1, "date": "2017-11-15", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "JJoSx8tEuO4I4FfZZIT7rA", "review_id": "31ABQ1hSx5qE_JlIrNBqgA", "text": "I visted Las Vegas from Chicago, I was looking for a good nail salon in this area for my wedding party.

He was happy to answer any questions or make suggestions.  He guided me to a good value delicious Cabernet.\n\nThe food was fantastic. The crab cake was delicious - not so much a cake as a lot of top quality crab meat mixed with some vegetables and sauce, mounded together.  The sauce for the crab cake was amazing.\n\nLobster bisque was rich with large chunks of lobster. Loved it.\n\nWe ordered two steaks - the prime ribeye and he bone in ribeye. Top notch. They are salted and seasoned, if you are sensitive to the taste of salt it might be a bit much. They will not salt it at your request it. Regardless, they were cooked to perfection and delicious. The truffle butter crab topping put the bone in ribeye over the top.\n\nWe had a couple sides - potatoes at gratin which were fine (a slight smoky flavor due to the bacon) and lobster mac & cheese, which was a bit sweeter than expected but still quite good.\n\nLastly, they surprised us with a complimentary cheesecake dessert.

I signed a personal training contract. Over the course of the past year I have been through 3 trainers who have quit or who were fired. The trainers were excellent and knowledgable. After the 3rd one left I was fed up with the turnover. I contacted the Arrowhead training manager to be let out of my remaining training sessions. My schedule had drastically changed after starting a new business and it was increasingly harder to make it on a regular basis. Add to that the thought of starting all over again with yet another trainer. I was told by the manager Brian that he would speak to the VP. After 3-4 emails to Brian I emailed the VP Mario. I emailed him twice about the situation  at Arrowhead location. I explained my situation in detail. I NEVER got any response from either email. I also called VP Mario on 2 separate occasions, left a voice mail. Again NO response or call. I then called and asked to speak to the owner or president. I was told I could not have their emails. They told me Mario was the one to talk to about complaints or concerns. I explained that Mario had chosen to ignore all 4 of my attempts to contact him. I got one phone message from Mario and told him when I could be reached...no attempt was made on his part to reach me again. \n\nThis is the final ( and 3rd) email I sent. I have NEVER gotten any response. \n\nWHAT A DISGRACEFUL COMPANY. Taking money for services not rendered, not responding to a member's concerns. I KNOW I am not the only one who has encountered this. \n\nSHAME ON YOU MOUNTAINSIDE FITNESS!!!!\n\nOctober 4, 2017\nMario - \n\nI am sorry I missed your call Monday afternoon at 3:45 p.m. I was in a meeting. I e-mailed you that I would be available after 4:15 p.m. I did not hear from you either via e-mail or phone. I also did not hear from you the next day to follow-up.\n\nTo say that I am frustrated is an understatement. I have been trying to deal with and get resolution to my issues since August 14.  I e-mailed back and forth with Brian with no results or true actions. On August 28 I decided to deal with you with the expectation that the VP would certainly be more concerned about his clientele and be professional in his actions and response times. \n\nI e-mailed you on August 28 and then about 5-7 days later. I received no acknowledgement that you had even read or received my e-mails and my concerns. I then called you on September 18 and left voicemail for you. I again called and left a voicemail for you on September 25. Again there was no response. \n\nSo now it is 4 weeks since my communication efforts with you have started and 6 weeks since this entire situation started. \n\nI have asked to be refunded for my remaining 93 sessions and have just been told I could be provided another trainer. Brian said if I could not make my appointments he would have some resolution for me. ( That was the e-mail from late August ).\n\nPersonal training, by nature, requires personal attention. The health and fitness industry is a service based industry. Clients need to feel they are valued, respected and have a positive and encouraging relationship with the trainer and the other gym personnel.  Sadly this appears not to be the case or priority with Mountainside Fitness. \n\nHow have your actions and your team members accomplished this? They haven't and you haven't. I feel like my concerns and my issues are being swept under the rug in hopes of it just going away. To have this as the culture in your managers and this company is so sad. \n\nThis very poorly handled situation has fractured our client relationship beyond repair. There has been no respect, no efforts, and definitely no customer service. \n\nI can't truly believe that under these circumstances you will not honor my request. Would you really ask that I continue to work out in such a negative environment?

Reviews don't lie! After searching through every possible Scooter Dealer shop within a 45 minute drive radius, I narrowed it down to 2 shops that sounded worth calling. I called one other Dealer, then Mopedman. My search stopped there! Mark answers his phone. That was the first good sign. And from there everything on his part was nothing less than absolute first class service, from start to finish! Mark was professional, polite & reliable as heck. His prices are great! (I've done all my research & this was also my 3rd Scooter purchase). And he is not only knowledgeable on all his products from the inside out, but he goes the extra mile to get you educated on what you're buying & gives extensive instruction on how to maintain it. Why is that so important? Just read the reviews about all the problems people have when shops DON'T DO THIS. He is extremely thorough. Needless to say, I bought a gorgeous Scooter there yesterday & road it home a few hours later! He has inventory ready to go in different model classes & choice colors. The one I happened to pick didn't come with a rear case (for extra storage). I asked for one & he through it in at no additional cost. My Scooter runs great & I have no doubt Mark will be there (as my go-to) in the future when I need help & for regular services. I don't write many reviews. Only when I feel I've found a business worth sharing (the wealth).

To be on the safe side, because we live really far away, we decided to look for a second vape as I really enjoy vaping now and they gave us a really good deal on a Plato, the pink one I fell in love with since the first time I've been there! Also, I got one more skull tip on an appropriate sice for my new device.\n\nI must say I'm thrilled and happy now I have my \"pen\" and a squared small one I can fit in any pocket/purse! Both in colors I like. \n\nSo I've read some reviews talking about bad costumer service and how they won't back you if you have a problem, keep in mind they're older reviews. So they obviously worked on their costumer service and are just amazing!\n\nI'm a loyal client now!

I took my 2010 nissan Altima coupe in to get repaired. I got side swiped on the whole passenger side of my car. So since I had some money saved up. I thought they could repair the damages and do a custom paint job for my whole entire car. It would be a metallic with a pearl in it. They did a good job at taking it apart and doing the body work and putting on aftermarket grill. I picked up my car on a Saturday Jason was off and it was only nicolle. I went with my friend when we left he said you can see blotchy spots on the car. So I waited til Monday to talk to Jason. I brought my friend with me who told Jason you can do a metallic with a pearl. Then Jason said you could. But prior to that he Jason told me you couldnt. I asked him what he could do to fix it. He came back and told me it would be ridiculous to repaint my whole car. Jason even said he say it was blotchy in the paint booth. If he saw it why not fix it. I think they are just used to doing insurance work and not experienced in Doing custom paint jobs. Whats funny that what they say on there business cards custom paint jobs. So I left and took it to a custom painter. He said it wasn't bad. But you can see that it is blotchy. I was very disappointed. So the next day I called the owner shane Jason brother. Told him I wasnt satisfied with the paint job. He told   me he wasn't going to repaint my car. Then started to tell me that he has painted over 1500 cars.  He even told me Bugz custom painter who is one of the best. Wouldnt have done as good job as they did. I could tell you this I know bugz and he would of done alot better then these clowns. It wouldn't have been blotchy. My friend wanted to get work done by orlandos after seeing my car he was like nope. Now I'm going to have to have bugz repaint it. I regret taking it to them. I should of waited for bugz. I got impatient and wanted it to get done right away. Oh yeah when I got my car back the pockets behind my seats where hanging. they broke the clips. When I called to tell Jason he was like why would we do that. I was like idk. Probably in a hurry. Then they didnt hook up my module to my door. So I took it took audio shop to have them fix it. The audio shop  even told me my car is blotchy. I didnt tell him anything. That is pretty embarrassing.

The hostess already put me in a relaxed mood when I called in to make my reso.  I asked for a table for two either 12:30 or 1 and she said \"let's reserve your table for 12:45 and you can come whenever you choose\" which was a good thing because we showed up at 1:15 and of course they didn't make a fuss at all.  \n\nI started with raw tuna if I remember correctly.  Don't know what it's called but it was served on a thin flake of something crunchy and orange centred radish slices on top.  The main was the halibut which came with the most delicately roasted vegetables.  I found the halibut itself a bit salty but I'm not sure if that because I'm from Vancouver and the halibut is different on the west coast.  Nevertheless this fish was very moist with melt in your mouth qualities.  I have to admit I wasn't sure about this texture as some parts were almost crumbly but I gave the chef the benefit of the doubt.  And let me say, it was brilliant to offer recommended pairings for only $7 for the demi size.  The wine came from some obscure places like Serbia but they tasted amazing.   The dessert was the only thing I wish could have been more exilirating on the tastebuds but the coffee was cherishable.\n\nOverall good food and service.  My only real criticism is they could try make the experience more exciting, and by that I mean making the food exude more attitude.  Almost as though you be thinking \"damn the chef is bad a s s\".  The interiors were a bit eccentric.  And the soft spokeness or lack there of of the other patrons made me feel like I was in an Atom Egoyan film.

Would give negative stars if allowed. bought a used 2015 Nissan Sentra in AZ for 14500 and put 7000 down.  The car had 23000 miles on it and was purchased Aug 1 2016. Just 2 weeks check engine light comes on.  We were told to take car to Lake Havasu.  The Service dept said we needed an appt.  Light went off.  Then shortly after, the car loses power.  Took it to dealer where we purchased it from and was told they only deal with Henderson Nissan.  By this time, we had put about 4000 miles on car.  Henderson SUPPOSEDLY put in brand new tranny.  Here we are again loses power.  Car gets taken to Henderson 90 miles away and the service manager Shane said there is no issue.  Back again in Dec.  Check engine light.  AZ was taking it back to Henderson.  Now this is 3 times it has been up there.  Went there myself to check on the status in which salesman Drake said the Sentra had an accident on the Carfax (750 in damage)  was unsafe and COULD NOT be sold on their lot. My Sentra only at this point had almost 30000 miles.  Still under factory warranty. Pressured me to buy a new car which I didn't want.  Still don't.  Wanted my Sentra fixed.  After spending 6 hrs there offered me a 2017 Versa with none of the options I wanted.  Was told we needed to put another 1000 which makes 8000 in 4 months down and trade in Sentra due to safety which would be going to Auction cause they can't sell on their lot.  Rushed thru paperwork was not explained on what I was signing, then find out they charged me 2500 for a service contract (extended warranty) and Vin # etching. None of this was explained.  Return home and find my Sentra still in AZ.  Never made it to NV.  The finance manager had the gall to ask us to drive it to NV. Talked to Nissans consumer affairs which handled nothing.  Henderson said we were VIP and havent heard a word from them.  I complained about not being told I had to pay registration fees in AZ so they reimbursed me for that 165.  I am now going above Nissan.  Worst car buying experience of my life.  2500 in unwanted extended warranty, and 199 for Vin etching.  Not one manager even called me.  I am not done with this dealer.  Horrible service,management, and sales.  They basically lied to get us in new car but I do have the pictures of my Sentra being sold on THEIR lot.

We travel with 2 kids (boy and girl) so we always try to book a larger suite. This time they did not make the excuses at the front desk they did last time.  So at least that was a positive.  Another positive the A/C in this room works.  The room is clean and well maintained, which makes the stay nicer.  The grounds and common areas are kept clean and attractive.\n\nCustomer Service - We have been staying for over 20 years at Hilton branded hotels,  70% at Embassy Suites.  I do not know if it is the Phoenix attitude, but at every other Embassy Suites around the country, the front desk recognizes my wife's elite status and welcomes us almost as friends. Most of them even leave a letter from the GM of hotel thanking us for our continued loyalty. Here we are not even acknowledged by the Front Desk as even being hhonors members.  Management needs to do some serious retraining of their Front Desk if they want to keep their Diamond members as return customers.  The best service is by the housekeeping and breakfast staff, who treat everyone as elite hhonors members. Which is how it should be for everyone.  Until the General Manager actually addresses the issues with the front desk this will remain a 3 star hotel in my book.\n\nIf you want to know how an excellent Embassy Suites operates, see my review on the one in Arcadia CA.  \n\nMaybe it is just that in Tempe they get a lot of traffic from ASU and Sky Harbour Airport, they do not feel the need to recognize loyality or choices of guests.  Next trip to Phoenix, we will be looking for a two room suite at a different Hilton Brand, like Squaw Peak or Tapatio Cliffs, where all the customer service is outstanding.  Even a Hampton Inn and Suites provides politer service at check-in. If not needing a suite for kids, the Airport Hilton in Phoenix is a much better, freindlier hotel.\n\nMaybe I am just of the wrong generation, where you were brought being taught that loyalty and customer service are the hallmarks of great establishments versus mediocre ones.   Nicely maintained rooms are to be expected at this brand and if just based on that alone and not the Customer Service we received both times, this would be a 5 star review.", "business_id": "rbreGWFCGNnBCEakGY4F0Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-02-22", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "b75_zK2nOs8cGuthOgZ0dA", "review_id": "jcQLOpC7KcPc9YBVEmtyxQ", "text": "If you are from the FSU or FSU Jewish, this is the store for you and your staples.

Maybe another casualty of getting on TV, and then raising prices lowering quality. I ordered a Midwest Monster. It was ok, nothing to write home about. The meat on it was very good it comes with Jalapenos and cheese and coleslaw. My only knock on the sandwich was that it was twelve dollars, It was microwaved to melt the cheese, and served on fifty cent bun from fry's. Again the meat on the sandwich was very good it wasn't warm though, obviously not hot enough to melt cheese.\n\nBut it comes with two side dishes you say.  \nI ordered the Mac and Cheese and Waffle Fries. The waffle fry's were the kind you get in the frozen section of your local supper market, and while the portion wasn't small it was also served cold. They were not fried from what I can tell but heated in an oven at some point and served room temp.To say I was unimpressed well no that is exactly what I was unimpressed. \n\nBut you also got Mac and Cheese you say. \nCrazy as this sounds it was also served cold, or what could be considered room temperature. We had Kraft Mac and Cheese the night before my wife told me it was better. The one thing I can say is they put a little paprika on the top and it does look like they make it from scratch. Not sure who else serves cold mac and cheese though I've never had it served that way at a restaurant before. \n\nIn Short it was twelve bucks for what couldn't even be called a real meal.

My husband is italian & although I did feel like the host at the front door who greeted us upon arrival & sat us down @ our seats was a little weird.  When she told us to enjoy our dinner she only told it to him not me, I mean literally looking him in his face, I almost felt imaginary lol. Idk maybe I was being too sensitive. Then when she sat us down she asked us if we wanted the small table sat for 2 or a bigger table set for 4. We choose the bigger table because the table for two was more for a table of 1 once you have food on it. We had to wait for the table to be cleaned off and set. We saw napkins forks & knives set on the table so my husband asked the lady if we could have a seat now, she then sarcastically said \"glasses\" as if he was dumb for not knowing that. After the table was set we had a seat & the lady apologized for the table not being ready upon our arrival. Our server was very nice & polite always checking up on us. I can't stand when your @ a resturant  & you have to look all over  for your sever. That was definitely not the case here.

Now even though I was super stuffed, I had a little bit of room for a taste test. We had apple strudel. mini chocolate donuts filled with camel, strawberry souffle, and a smore cake.

It's six courses, the first being shrimp scampi, the second being a tomato based soup, the third being hummus and vegetable platter, the fourth being beef kabobs, the fifth being chicken and couscous, and the sixth and last being a fruit, powdered sugar, filo dough dessert. Everything was family style and amazing. Oh and they really don't give you any silverware, so you have to eat with your hands, good thing they wash your hands with rose water before hand. I really can't tell you which of the six dishes was my favorite, everything had a unique delicious taste. \n\nThe other great thing about this restaurant was the entertainment. Every 15 minutes or so a belly dancer would come and dance about two or three songs. The girls are beautiful and it's amazing how they move their bodies. They also interact with the crowd, they encourage people to come up and dance with them. When I was there some of the crowd was getting too happy - they were making it rain on the belly dancers - throwing lots and lots of dollar bills at them. \n\nI can't wait to come back again.

Everything was nicely battered and great portions. It came with 6 pieces of shrimps, and a good variety of vegetables like mushrooms, taro, eggplant, yam, and zucchini. I would also highly recommend the Chirashi Deluxe, the sashimi was so fresh and so much variety. There was salmon, toro, uni, amber jack, roe, unagi, octopus, shrimp, and more!

I'm sorry, I didn't have the burgers for which they are so famously amazing. We went for lunch yesterday. Cheerful atmosphere. Very busy. We had to wait for a wee bit which was awkward as there were so many people waiting we were blocking the door. They just don't have a lot of space of there are a few people waiting (maybe 8). But things moved quickly so we didn't mind. \nThe servers were pretty friendly and we had maybe 4 different servers. So I'm not sure whether they are allocated tables or duties. Leaving a tip...not sure who it goes to! \nFirstly my boyfriend had the beef brisket which looked very yummy. He later told me it was dry, which is quite unfortunate. He's not overly picky and isn't one to complain so this says quite a bit. \nFor myself, a native Canadian I obviously ordered the poutine. My first one in 3 years, a dish that I adore and rave about it to people who have never had it. I was disappointed. The only redeeming factor was the cheese curds. Real cheese curds. That was ace. Other than that I had a a plate of gravy and soggy chips. Too much gravy! It was drowning in gravy. That wouldn't be appetising to anyone. So if someone whose never had poutine before tries it from Bread meats Bread I think they too would probably rate it average and not have it again. It also seems to have been baked, as the chips were baked to the bottom of the dish and my first bite was lukewarm. Underneath was hot so perhaps it had been sitting under the warmer for a while? Hence the super soggy chips?! Either way..:it's an easy dish to throw together it's unnecessary for it to be baked or put under a warmer. The construction of a poutine is simple, chips, pile of cheese curds and hot gravy over top. Not so much that it's drowning in gravy. But enough HOT gravy to melt the cheese curds and puddle amongst the chips. Some chips at the very bottom would eventually get a bit soggy but overall you should have plenty of crispy chips mopping up the gravy. Ah I'm ranting now. I couldn't finish it and mentioned to the waitress clearing out plates that the poutine had too much gravy and she just said she'd tell the chef. Whatever that means. \nWe also had some onion rings which I cannot rate. They were not to my liking. The coleslaw was nice if not a bit too creamy for my liking. And the medium glass of wine I ordered was very nice but over priced (\u00a35!). \nAll in all I've given the place 3 stars as most people love this place on their experiences of fantastic burgers. I would have given it 2 stars on my experience alone. I'm not sure I would go back. \nSorry lovers of Bread meats Bread....but lovers of poutine will be disappointed.", "business_id": "OvbLKXkJCg8ZMHX9L5faIA", "stars": 3, "date": "2016-01-17", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "GoJPBrs_xZmLiYPZrrzOkA", "review_id": "vkk364lt28aPwQCQxQy_ww", "text": "I am sure I have written a review for this place before but think it's worth updating it. \n\nThis is by far one of my favourite restaurants in Edinburgh. And anywhere really. I'll tell you why...\n\nFirstly, the food is always outstanding. I typically go chicken or prawn panang. It's gorgeous. And sometimes gaeng massaman. Also gorgeous. I've tried a few of their stir-frys which are equally as lovely and I think once Pad Thai...always yummy. But in a thai restaurant like this I tend to steer clear of Pad Thai as there's so many gorgeous dishes. I like to try a different starter each time I go and I have never been disappointed. \n\nSecondly, Everything always tastes fresh and flavourful. I find the portions to be slightly large unless I'm sharing with someone. Between a starter and main you're stuffed. \n\nThirdly, I tend to eat here once a month, sometimes twice because of the above (and I love Thai food) but mainly for the fact that the owner and staff are just absolutely lovely. They always greet us warmly and the ones that recognise us always ask how we are. I have been bringing my son (7 now) here since he was 4 and they are as happy to receive him now as they were then. And they often give him a free kids ice-cream because they are just awesome like that. Not once have I ever been uncomfortable eating there with my son. They never made me feel awkward or badly for when he was messier and louder. They have always been brilliant. \n\nFourthly, to expand on my previous point they so obviously love their local repeat customers. I just recently went for dinner here for my birthday. The owner who had come over to chat with us asked what we were celebrating and when I told him he graciously offered is desserts on the house :) who would mind that?! (Just to point out it there was only 2 of us)\n\nFifthly, I don't love their dessert selection and I LOVE dessert. But I don't care as I'm too full from the amazing starter and mains. However I had the lemon sorbet and that was really nice. Came in a real frozen lemon as well! \n\nSo that's my love of Phuket Pavillion in 5 crucial points I suppose. I could talk about their prices but let's be realistic...Thai food in Edinburgh is pricey. And there's a few better known places that have the worst service and average food that charge the same or more (chaopraya for one).", "business_id": "E_scgX9Vws9adbh4i_QJnQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-10-06", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "7oedjQ9pWZQi6KDAFHoPQQ", "review_id": "Ilph9FtsyfqA4dKGC9gbhg", "text": "Came to Vegas for my birthday and got a killer American Traditional tat by R.

Chicken breast was moist and fried to perfection.  The breading was flour with the jerk seasoning.  The waffles were light and airy and crisp around the edges. So good. So-so good.\n\nBreakfast Potatoes - cubed red potatoes with yellow and red peppers and onions.  And the spices were just right.  They were spicy, but it didn't linger, you know what I mean?  Like the potatoes were not spicy just to be spicy, they had flavor.\n\nI told Bryce I had just landed at McCarren and came directly to DWB - he thought that was a hoot, but was appreciative.\n\nI will continue to make DWB part of my trips to Vegas.

We were extremely happy especially because we were trying to watch the costs as much as possible and we were unsure if we would be able to witness the burial. Not only did he work quickly but he was also very compassionate with us and understood our sadness. He also allowed us to say goodbye to our father the same day that we were there to finish the paperwork and I cannot thank him enough for letting us get that closure. We had a tough time finding the perfect casket and he went out of his way to find us something that was perfect for him and offered it at a cost that we could afford. He informed us that because of our Father's time in the Military Reserves, we would be given an American Flag in his honor. On the day he was buried I was very surprised to arrive and see that Tom went out of his way again to call the Military and have them at the service to do a special Ceremony for him.

You can see all the costumes of famous rock and rollers. I liked the Elvis exhibit. You can see his books, his diary, his note to join the army, and there is also a movie about him. The Rolling Stones and the Beatles are there as well. There is a lot to see on the first floor. That's were most of the stuff is. You can take a escalator up to the second, third, and fourth levels. On the third level you can use machines to pick your favorite rock and roll songs and listen away! On the fourth level there is a small restaurant, where you can buy yummy food to eat. The fourth level has the best view of Lake Erie as well. But soon two more floors will have an even better view of the Lake! The Fifth and sixth levels are currently being built. I REALLY enjoyed my visit to the rock and roll hall of fame! But I bet the next time that I visit the rock and roll hall of fame, it will be even better because of the brand new fifth and sixth floors! Rock on, Cleveland!

The keema naan is just naan \"bread\" stuffed with lamb meat. The medium spice on the butter chicken is spicier than \"medium.\" However, I really enjoy it! The white rice that the dish comes with helps tame the spiciness. I do find myself taking some breaks in between bites. If you aren't someone that regularly eats spicy food I would recommend mild spice. This dish also contains peanuts, so beware to those that can't consume nuts! I enjoy ordering the naan with this entree because it works like a sponge to soak up all the sauce from the butter chicken and it is like a palate cleanser.

I was not there at the time, but it I had been, I would have told him to leave and gotten someone else.   My husband made him stick to the $59.00 price.   What you get for $59.00 for two rooms from this company is steam cleaning and nothing else.  He would not use shampoo or any of the \"eco\" products they advertise.  Just plain water steam.   When he was finished, there were still indents in the carpet from the beds that had been there.   He was asked to rake the carpet up and the technician told him that would be an additional charge.

Needed a break from the usual Biltmore corridor fare. Someone threw out the idea of bbq and this was closest. \n\nLarge place, lots of seating at booths or tables (seat yourself) clean, dark and casual. Sparsely decorated with no real theme or atmosphere and a couple of TVs playing quietly. You order at the counter and they bring it to your table. Meats come un-sauced and they have three or four different sauces at a central counter you help yourself to. Crowd was sparse and a mix of suits and uniforms  service was friendly and competent and they explained how to order since it was our first time. \n\nMy lunch mate had the pulled pork sandwich which is simply meat in a bun and a side of green chili Mac and cheese. \n\nI had a two meat combo with brisket and tri-tip and the Mac on the side and ordered a slice of the gooey butter cake for us to share. Combo comes with Texas toast. \n\nPulled pork was excellent, smoky and well cooked. The brisket and tri-tip were ok, not horrible, not memorable and all my food, including the toast, was room temperature and dry. Mac and cheese are individual (not suitable for sharing as an FYI) a la carte portions and was tasty and heated through. Drinks are also self service and the ice tea was fresh and it appears they have beer, wine and cocktails. My lunchmate noted that the choices are \"white\" and \"red\" and are $9 a glass, cocktails are $7 and beers are $5, going on memory. \n\nCombined this very simple meal was about $35.00+ and frankly for that much was not comparable to what you'd get for the same money at many other places in the area, for instance at OSHO a short distance away that serves really great hit and juicy pulled pork, brisket and pastrami sandwiches with good sides in a slightly nicer environment, or for that matter Hillstones at the Biltmore, where we could have eaten for a comparable cost.", "business_id": "N3GQ4GhQviglogQR1dPNgg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-10-16", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "tWJrrj2WUCCU5l6DwvRnOQ", "review_id": "rvX9ujCzL0ZTrfTfz_WNRA", "text": "Great food in a small, loud restaurant and bar populated by neighborhood cougars and the men that love them, at least while they are there.

We got Italian sodas and  the price is what we would have spent at Chipotle, so it is very affordable   The sauce was not as temperature hot as I would have liked, so the dish was cold in spots, but hey, it's pasta,s so it can be eaten cold, which I do frequently, so I was not upset.  The best part was the garlic piada that comes with the pasta or the salad.  It reminded me of Naan, which I LOVE and I love garlic naan, so already liking it.  IT'S FULL OF CHEESE!    I am an unabashed cheese freak (you can never have too much cheese or chocolate).  The artichokes were cleaned, grilled with nice crispy char, and (cue the fan fare) acidulated ( you need to put fresh ones in water with lemon juice or they turn brown. Like avocado's for guac.)

Noodles were way over cooked, soup doesn't have much lemon grass flavor and it has too much meat going on in there from tendons to pigs skins to pieces of slices of beef shanks and meat patties like. The pork blood wasn't fresh - has a stinky smell to it and there weren't enough Vietnamese herbs and vegetables that should come with this noodle dish on the side.

The reviews were very good, the restaurant was close and there was a good time available. As I was alone, I was given a small table close to the kitchen, which was understandable. However, I didn't really enjoy the constant parade of waiters brushing my shoulder every time they went by. Service from my waiter was a bit slow and he was indifferent. Whenever I try a new steakhouse, I normally order my favorite, tenderloin Oscar Style. To me this is a perfect way to see if a steakhouse is worth its' salt. With a name like Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab expectations were understandably high. I ordered it medium rare. When it came, it came with crab on top and sauce on the side, it looked like a beautiful piece of meat but was disappointed when I cut into the middle of it and it was RAW, as in the top 1/4\" and bottom 1/4\" were cooked properly but the middle 1\" looked blue. When I told my waiter that it was RAW in the middle, he started an argument with me by asking me \"I thought you ordered it medium rare?\", I said \"I did, but this is RAW in the middle.\" \"So you don't want it medium rare?\" I said, \"That isn't medium rare.\" \"You sure?\" as he made a big show of bending down and examining the steak and then giving a patronizing look. \"So you would like your steak cooked medium, then?\" I said \"Medium rare\" He eventually took my plate back to the kitchen and 20 min later came out with it again. The steak was now overcooked, the sides were cold, which means they didn't keep my plate warm, the crab was now off to the side and not on top and the b\u00e9arnaise sauce was cold. I know I was a single table but I didn't deserve to be treated like crap. I'm sure most people get treated better than I but I cannot recommend this place to anybody.

Both times have been alright, but absolutely nothing to write home about.\n\n\n The first time, with my friend, I had the chicken burrito while she had the chicken quesadilla. She enjoyed her quesadilla, but admitted she didn't know how authentic it was as she hadn't tried one before. My burrito was alright. I had the pinto beans the hot salsa and paid the extra for guacamole, sour cream and jalapenos. Despite this, I found it to be very dry, there was no taste on the chicken from the marinade, the hot salsa had no heat and the jalapenos were underwhelming to say the least.\n\n\n I went back a second time, a few weeks later, to give the place a second chance. I ordered the same thing again in case I had just been in at a bad time before, but unfortunately it was even drier this time due to the fact that I didn't get the sour cream I'd asked, and been charged, for. I didn't realise this until later on, so it wasn't brought up with the staff at the time.\n\n\n Now don't get me wrong, there is nothing bad about the food there at all. It's just underwhelming. To me, the marinade does nothing to the chicken, the salsa and jalapenos are both marked as hot when they are nothing of the kind and there is no where near enough moisture in the burrito.\n\n\n I fully accept that this is down to my own personal tastes, but if I am to go back, it will purely be for convenience and nothing else.\n\n\n There's far too much hype put out about this place and you really shouldn't believe it all.", "business_id": "L3GSBM-3cUGiEWqcnNF9lA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-07-30", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "Q58U8-HyTDAYEGY13DLEUw", "review_id": "wiyqawSJHQO_q3js5EfQOQ", "text": "Lovely wee pub at Haymarket, that always seems busy.\n\n\n There is a basement bar as well, that features comedy every Thursday as well as other regular nights.\n\n\n Only eaten in here a couple of times, but the tempura prawns are lovely!!", "business_id": "eeN4omwZZc8C3O-XAxZ-HQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-01-06", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "Q58U8-HyTDAYEGY13DLEUw", "review_id": "BN9Sd0COGv4Kmpyo0I1wdQ", "text": "I've been to Zucca twice now.

You do have the option on most to choose baked or fried.\nYou can also get dip with it, they have two options for dip. My personal fav is the spinach one which is more orange in color, it has a bit of spice/kick to it.\nThey aren't as filling as i would have hoped , so you end up having to buy a few to feel satisfied.

Which was a bit awkward. They forgot my side order of baked beans, which was a bit annoying. I ordered the CHILAQUILES RANCHEROS, which was just ok to be honest. The poached eggs were done perfectly, the tortilla and veggies were really soggy , lastly the home fries were ok. I also got a few chips w them which were nice for dipping \n\nMy partner got chicken and waffles. He felt the waffles weren't crispy enough and the jalape\u00f1o flavour was a bit too much . After we received our food we still had to flag down the waiter for cutlery and syrup. \n\nExperience and food was ok but definitely not worth the wait..prices are fair but based on everything as a whole won't be returning .", "business_id": "bu_vAwJG1DHhM5f6ePjXog", "stars": 3, "date": "2017-03-19", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "XYl43Jgcl_AgM5YXDFVy5A", "review_id": "7pm9QfyUbYnwJPIDn2KoSw", "text": "I loved this place\nCustomer service is stellar\nThe pies are to die for ..super tasty\nnice flaky pie crust consistency and flavorful on the inside\nServing size is amazing i went in for lunch and couldn't finish my pie had the rest as a snack after work\nWill definitely be back", "business_id": "ofw8aDSEg1HoQdmCgvLtaQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2016-10-24", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "XYl43Jgcl_AgM5YXDFVy5A", "review_id": "fce90Yu0xH38QbGuUXU9Fg", "text": "Let me start by saying WOW, not sure why they have low reviews but also humans tend to complain about the smallest things and we love to place blame.\nThis was my first time here, I usually go to the Scarborough location (amazing food), been to the Creditview location once (thumbs down).

I mean there was even fruit flies , such a turn off.\nFinally we find our theater and the previews are nearly the end but the place is full of kids or teens whatever they are still talking and using their phones.

The soup dumplings (Xiao long bao) were juicy, the cold pork cut with garlic (Suan ni bai rou) hit the spot perfectly.

The pizzas themselves were alright - I enjoyed the crust, but the flavour combinations sounded better on paper than in reality. We ordered the BC, the special (some meaty boar pizza) and the Shinny, a mushroomy pizza. The sauce tasted homogenously tomatoey, with varying levels of spiciness.

The prices are good for what it is, and coming from a place where sushi is $$$, this is always a treat. And the selection is awesome - perhaps not necessarily the types of rolls (average, I'd say), but lots of non-sushi items that are excellent.\n\nI'd have to agree with the previous reviewers that the service is not stellar; like most Chinese-run sushi restaurants, it takes some effort to flag down someone for more tea or your bill. It's definitely an efficient no-nonsense type environment, where the servers are curt in taking your order or bringing you food, without spending too much time pampering and sweet talking for a bigger tip. Personally, I don't mind this (I'm here to fill my belly with sushi, not get asked 100 times how the food is), but I suppose some people might find this poor service. \n\nDon't expect to get your palate tickled by high-end Japanese delicacies.

Its the only one i've ever been to and im soo glad that it is literally just seconds from my home. I've been coming to this fish and chips store ever since i was a kid and was attending  the elementary school down the street. I gotta say the prices did go up... i remember buying just the chips for $2.10 and now its about $3.25. I remember asking the lady there why did you guys increase the price (just out of curiosity) and she claimed that they haven't and it was always at that price which is completely wrong lool. \n\nBut nevertheless i really love this fish and chips store....i usually just get the chips but whenever i buy both, the fish comes out really greasy and if you squeeze it a bit, it does drip out of your hands so if you have high cholesterol or not into oily fish then stay away!\n\n But in my case the fries i gotta say is AMAZING its actually the best tasting fries i have ever  tasted (and i've tasted many different fries but this beats them all!!). They have other things on the menu like onion rings and other types of fish and beef-gravy (no chicken) but i have never had any other things in the menu besides there specialty. \n\nThere is no seats inside to sit and eat, just a little waiting area around the corner to wait for your order but they do have a little bench outside that people tend to sit and enjoy there fish and chips. The store itself isn't appealing...dark and full of potted plants on the window and not bright. \n\nBut overall i only go for the food..don't really care much about the store design. The price of the chips if ya'll are wondering is $3.25 for the chips and $9.90 for the fish and chips. \n\nOh, most importantly this is CASH ONLY they don't accept visa/debit and they do have a beverage fridge in the corner.", "business_id": "GtO_zfsrgShKG7KW6zahSg", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-07-23", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "Fe-oeVVYbPvQkZ3fLAlyig", "review_id": "DKy7i4ZL6glIUHUslnYCAg", "text": "After a long day shopping of course we got hungry so we went to Pickle Barrel to eat.

My credit was not strong enough to purchase a vehicle on my own even though I make a great deal of money per year from my government job.  Okay, Sure understandable.  One of the managers scolded me for helping in signing for too many OTHER cars...then he aggressively insisted that others help me sign into a vehicle in the same manner in which I helped them sign into theirs.  I left the establishment browsing vehicles as I left knowing I would eventually be back because I like Hyundai engineering and the location was convenient to the freeway.  My departure browsing was mostly for show because they made me feel humiliated and I'm a hard working gentleman...so I didn't want to give them the satisfaction of leaving \"tuck tail\" beaten dog like.  The original salesman met me outside as I was leaving the establishment and encouraged me if I could convince my mother to return with me she could sign with me and I could get a car.  I went home and talked it over with my mom.  While home, ABC Hyundai called and assured us we would leave with a car if only I could get my mother APPLY ONLINE then return with me as a co signer.  I explained to them I could have money down but not until a few days later after I get paid.  It was 730pm and my 59 year old mom worked at 5am the next day.  She agreed to help me because she has a kind and caring heart.  We returned to ABC Hyundai and they started the credit process AGAIN because for \"Some reason\" they couldn't locate her online application that SHE JUST SENT ONLINE BEFORE LEAVING THE HOUSE.  So after another 9 minutes AFTER ARRIVING and recollecting my mothers info into their tablet...all of the workers huddled back in their offices with my mothers NEWLY ACQUIRED information  EVEN THOUGH SHE ALREADY SENT IN AN ONLINE APPLICATION.  They eventually came out...offering a \"Gift\" that would only be approved in my mothers name because my own credit history was too negative.  The \"gift\" offered was a single choice of vehicle...their smallest, and the oldest vehicle that had been test driven for over 1 year.  The 2018's are on the lot...and they only offered her a 2017 with over 60 miles on the odometer (the test drive was only 4 miles).  Okay, sure understandable.  Fair, enough.  Whatever...that's all I could say.  Perhaps they could have mentioned that all to us.  I brought my mother back into their lot....the fact that my name wouldn't be on the registration and all the pressure would alllll be on just my mom alone was kept secret.  They already ran my credit beforehand.  They had my mothers credit from the ABC Hyundai website WHICH SHE SENT IN 45 minutes prior...they could have had things figured out BEFORE we arrived since my down payment was already written on paper as to what date I could provide it.  So after explaining the \"Gift\" on how they're going to clear their inventory and shift us a year old dinosaur....they asked...yes, wait for it.....HOW I WOULD BE PUTTING THE MONEY DOWN!!!???  Facepalm...\"You guys don't remember telling you clearly that I have no money down today???\"  Seems they selectively forgot that fact.\n\nSo we sign and we're out of there by 1030pm.  My poor mother needs rest but is excited to help introduce a vehicle into the family (Even though I will be making the payments myself, we call it HER car :)  ).  So the next day she must return to deliver the cash which they THOUGHT I was going to deliver the 1st night, even though I clearly stated....NO MONEY TONIGHT AT ALL...LATER MONEY YES....NONE TONIGHT...LATER YES...NONE TONIGHT....\nWe sign a few more papers which were over looked the 1st day.  Okay, great now everything is in order.  Right???\n\nTurns out they forgot ANOTHER item and now me and my mom had to return a THIRD time.  One of the dates on the original contract was not updated the 2nd time around and either we come back a 3rd time to sign, or we would be lacking a particular vital insurance coverage.  So, yes of course we returned for a 3rd visit.  \n\nIt feels strange to sign a contract that says, \"once you leave the lot you are the owner of the vehicle in which there's no backing out\"....but then to be slammed with several messages for days afterwards which state...return to the lot or else the original deal will be modified.\n\nSo the experience was completed, yes.  Yes, we did get the car.  Yes, they did work with us eventually.  But it felt as though a court trial, circus, and comedy ROAST were were all combined into one package.  No not very pleasant.  I told them I will need another car in 30 days...but I'now I'm hesitant.  Do I really want to submit myself to that treatment again??  I'm happy to have a vehicle which I can pay for...but must I be humiliated and made to come back time and time again?  Nobody even offered Coffee or Cocoa like they did on the 1st night!  :(\nCoffee/Cocoa must be hot brewed and takes time....they will only volunteer water unless you ask otherwise...", "business_id": "G6GWOAPmCGSiMleJUzta8A", "stars": 2, "date": "2017-12-10", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "Pni3Z-FG6frCZLJBdFyMhw", "review_id": "Y56kh26ZAl4bD8pVq-tZGw", "text": "Visited twice to the India Palace restaurant on my trip to Las vegas.

In  speaking to others they have also shared their experiences with poor customer service at this location.  I live in Goodyear so it's unfortunate. I had a waitress who first thought it excusable to not wait my table for more than 20 minutes after being seated, then she tried lie by saying she wasn't our waitress, to make maters worse she claimed my husband was cursing at her(which he never even gave a tone like he was using foul language) and the worst part is she continued to harass us by returning to our table after I had requested the manager. I finally decided to walk to the counter to ask for the manager myself she followed me continuing to harass me. The manager wasn't much better.

He was checking with the host to see if maybe tables were switched on her or something that could have thrown her off. I don't think that should matter, regardless of the reason, there should be no excuse for that type of behavior. He did apologized and asked if there was anything he could do for us. I was not looking for handouts,  but in my past experience with poor service, the management has never asked me if there is anything they could do for me. Instead they took the initiative to try and make things right. Then I received an email response which stated \"We strive very hard to make orders correct the first time, but we are only human and we sometimes make mistakes.\" This was spilled water, that would be a mistake.

My first visit, it was all I could do to get in the office I was in such bad shape. I had many injuries over the years and never really healed from them properly. I was in constant pain. I hobbled around like I was 150 years old. I did not want to rely on prescription meds to ease my pain. So I went to Community Chiropractic. I left that first day feeling better than I had felt in years. But due to my many years of neglecting my body, I needed much more attention than you can get in one visit. Dr Eaton worked with me and helped me understand what I needed to do to get  the best response from my body. He also showed me ways to make my body stronger in my problem/injured areas so I could be in less pain. Getting stronger has enabled me to a better quality of life with a lot less pain and aggravation. I once thought I was doomed to a life of pain. So glad things have turned around for me. I credit much of that to Dr Eaton. My visits now are much less frequent then they once were also. Just another sign that what Dr Eaton does WORKS!\nFrom the moment you walk into the office, you know you're in a place that truly cares. Maryanne always greets you with a cheery welcome and makes you feel like you're with people that care about you. Because they do! Usually not much of a wait before Dr Eaton has you in a treatment room.  Once inside his hands on approach will have you feeling better in no time. He is always kind and caring. Very thorough and..... he's the best! It is really the only way I can describe my visits. Maryanne and Spencer are wonderful people! I can't say enough!  Another thing I really like/love about them.... even though we're all here in the big city, they give you that small town community feel. Community Chiropractic is the BEST!

After the wine arrived we were left unattended for a long while to the point that I had to ask for the check three times to two different people.

We were introduced to Tom, the owner,  who offered his expertise.  Everyone at Lynne's were very upbeat and professional including the gal at the front desk and the warehouse guys who packed the  furniture in our trailer...it took 3 trips to get everything home...We enjoyed our shopping experience and will definitely return.", "business_id": "e-NX-4YEUrxvn_vd6pqUaA", "stars": 5, "date": "2017-05-04", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "us-v0xh7xVNi-12T6KyPDg", "review_id": "HAdAE5WmPj_I3Vzhmh_3HQ", "text": "Been seeing Dr A rn for almost 25 years and wouldn't trust my pointers health well being to any other vet.

I woke up on Friday morning before an extended weekend with intense tooth pain. My former dentist of five years was closed for the holiday and unable to see me until the following Wednesday. That's no good, my tooth hurts and I'm apparently whining like a small child. My girlfriend called and scheduled me an appointment (way to reward my bad behavior) with Dr Chiem, and they were able to squeeze me in later that same day. \n\nTurns out my old dentist hadn't done the best job installing a cavity. A portion of the cavity had fallen out (hence the pain). The cavity had failed and my tooth has been rotting and I now required a root canal. I was given an estimate (which was very fair) with the opportunity to have to work done right then and there. There's not much I can say, it went as well as a root canal can go. I was given plenty of numbing medication and the doctor checked my comfort levels throughout the procedure (I didn't feel a thing. About an hour later and I was done. I was fitted for a crown and a followup appointment was scheduled for the following week. I left with two prescriptions and less roots. \n\nMy mouth was slightly sore the next morning from being stuck open for so long, and the surrounding gums were also a little sensitive (I was warned this would be the case). I took my pain meds and antibiotics as prescribed and everything felt fine the next morning. I had one more follow up appointment, at no charge, before scheduling my crown install. My tooth was inspected to insure the doctor was comfortable with the results before installing my crown. I couldn't feel anything around the tooth (that's good, that's the whole point of the procedure). I was told to finish up my antibiotics and we scheduled my install appointment for my crown. I'll update my review when they're done with the crown, unless I forget, in which case I'm either dead and unable to update or forgot to update. Either way, I wouldn't fault Stars Dental, unless they somehow killed me by installing a crown. I'm going to assume my gf would update my review or leave her own review discussing how they killed me and I'm now haunting the office.

I went in to get my order at this tiny window that has no line of sight so you're left waiting awkwardly because you can't see them and they can't see you. Then I'm told with my order one item was not available. I simply asked them to take it off the order and was told \"no I can't\". I'm sorry what? So I'm not getting the product I ordered, yes you offered something else that was not wanted, but refuse to take the expense off if the offered replacement is not taken? This makes zero sense to me.

The flavours were there... but was nothing spectacular, and I wish there was a little more than 3 pieces.

It tasted quite dry and resembled a chicken nugget more than anything.\n\nFor my main course I ordered the Veal Osso Buco with tomato sauce and red wine. I found it quite tough and dry, and the sauce did not have any red wine taste to it. It was pretty disappointing. I had a few bites of my friend's lamb shank (in the same sauce) and although it was more tender than my veal, I still felt it was missing that \"off the bone\" tenderness and yummy lamb taste. \n\nLastly, I had the warm white chocolate lava cake. This was quite good; the white chocolate centre and vanilla ice cream really balanced out the sweetness of the chocolate cake. It was also very wam and soft, but it seemed like it was heated last minute in the microwave. It was still a nice finish to the meal.\n\nOverall, the food was quite mediocre and since the tables were all very close to one another, I felt very cramped during my dining experience.

The cookies and cream chocolate dip was soooooooooooo thick I feel like I've never had an ice cream cone dip like that before!

The chocolate dip was also exactly like a cookies and cream bar; it felt like I was eating ice cream and a whole bar at the same time.

Plus, the strawberry ice cream (which paired really well with the cookies and cream) helped even out the sweetness.\n\nOverall, the \"mini\" size was more than enough for me, making the price quite worth it.\n\nThey also have a vast array of chocolates (including Belgian chocolates and some matcha flavoured ones), as well as gelato and milkshakes--I'm pretty excited to try those out soon!\n\nIt's been a few days since I visited, and I'm still telling my friends and family how awesome the cone dips were!

(That meal I would give a 2/5). \n\nThis time, from the recommendation of my sister, I got the Miso Ramen. This was the complete opposite of the shoyu soup I had because I found this soup to be too bland. It just didn't wow me! And although I could have finished the bowl at the end of the meal, I chose not to because I didn't find the soup that great. It was, however, an improvement from the Shoyu Ramen. \n\nThe thick noodles were quite good, but the toppings that come with all the ramen were lacking. I did find their pork to be very tender and juicy though. \n\nMy friends ordered the original Ramen which comes with an egg (whereas the miso did not) and they both said they enjoyed their ramen and soup. \n\nOverall, kinton feels very average to me, and since it's in proximity to where I usually \"chill\", I most likely will come back....if I'm desperate. \n\nPerhaps next time I'll try the spicy garlic ramen--I'm sure that one might be more flavourful. But for now, I have yet to find something \"special\" about kinton.", "business_id": "piZ4JqJI5WTljJuQV7yZHQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2017-01-28", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "P-HfoWZ4nrgqhqEbbhWuUw", "review_id": "s7NWvNoAl0YCaCvZYVoahw", "text": "I just recently came in contact with Angela through Mountain Pacific Insurance.

A Mexican lady attempted to cook my husband and I Mediterranean food. Our kabob plate was a flattened, grilled chicken breast. It was seasoned with chili powder and served with a green salsa (delicious, but not Mediterranean). She had to look at the photos on the menu in order to make the plates. She did not speak English. When she brought out the hummus (that appeared to be aged based on darkened color and thickness), she did not understand that pita was supposed to come with it. Finally, by using the Spanish word for bread, she brought us a plate with a thick piece of dense, stale bread. We tried the food, just for the heck of it, and the woman actually did a spectacular job on the chicken and salsa. But what we were served, was not Mediterranean. That lady could not possibly work there. She had zero clue how or what to cook. On top of our chicken 'kabob' plate and hummus, we also got a chicken pita gyro.... and because she looked at the photo, it was ACTUALLY ON A PITA! The pita however, was older than I could probably count on all of my fingers and toes, and harder than a rock. So, we passed on it. We finally got to the paying part of the visit and when I thought the experience couldn't get any weirder.. it did. The Mexican lady came around the counter and looked up at the photo menu with prices, counted, added, and gave us a price of $26 in Spanish. My husband gave her the correct price, $29 and then told her that we had a restaurant.com coupon for $15. He relayed it to her a second time in Spanish, and when she 'understood', she said that we could only pay her in cash. So we gave her the difference and a tip (because even though she obviously didn't actually work there or have any idea what she was doing in terms of Mediterranean, she cooked a phenomenal chicken and made authentic salsa). The lady didn't even ring in the order, so she obviously couldn't log in to the iPad. I have no idea what she was doing in this hole in the wall, run down business, but she didn't belong. The restaurant looked like it shouldn't be in business any longer.

We spoke with one of the staff, who gave us pretty good recommendations on a few dishes that we could try, and I must admit, all the dishes were cooked very nicely, great taste, though they are on the pricier side, I feel that  you get what you pay for (if you want better quality food, it comes at a price). \n\nSoya sauce chicken is AMAZING. The chicken was super smooth, moist, and the soy taste was not overpowering the chicken. \nWe ordered this dish that had a variety of greens, including zucchini, lotus, celery, parsnip(?) stir-fried. it was delicious! the ingredients are fresh, and it wasn't too oily for a stir-fry.\nFor those who love seafood, their honey fried oysters are wonderful! The texture was nice and crisp, full of the honey flavour, and the oysters were HUGE! Definitely a delight to eat :)\n\nNext time I would like to try their lobster and their peking duck (they do have some dinner specials)!", "business_id": "dKOrxsz6ygqa-AatwzpKyQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2016-01-08", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "YMTcBb6Vj54rd_NuFtb8QQ", "review_id": "Vs4ec8QQdXVnzgFbApQo0Q", "text": "I came here on my way to visit my friend's new baby on a Saturday morning. this little cafe totally reminds me of the local coffee shops i used to frequent in downtown Toronto back in the days before I moved out to the suburbs... i love this little gem!! It's not a very big space, but it's cosy, with some tables and chairs for small groups to meet. \n\nThey do have a vareity of options for breakfast and lunch. The espresso and coffee menu is also quite diverse. I ordered a caffe latte and a scone and muffin. the green tea white chocolate scone was delish! it had hints of those flavours and the scone was soft and fluffy. the bluberry bran muffin was also another great item to try on the menu. They have sandwiches, yogurts and cookies available as well.\n\nThe latte was really well done. I enjoyed every sip of that cup! I also like how they do a bit of latte art on their drinks (yes even for take out ones) and i'ts just a nice little touch. They also have a variety of milk options for those who can't drink regular milk (lactose free, almond, coconut,soy) - their prices are also quite reasonable and not super expensive. I bought their espresso coffee home - 1 bag is 15 dollars, again cost is quite reasonable and they do roast their own coffee (another perk coz i love buying local coffees to use at home).\n\nThis place is not too far from home, so def. expect me to be back on a regular basis!", "business_id": "sd4BuC4Om6WuvnP87ZS8Og", "stars": 5, "date": "2016-07-26", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "YMTcBb6Vj54rd_NuFtb8QQ", "review_id": "MIJipUuGwSrEw6QyPA9NLQ", "text": "My future MIL - bless her, she actually went and got both the original and the matcha cheesecakes!!

We came in on a Monday night and the place is pretty full for a weekday evening. Ambience is nice, casual, they have both dinner seating as well as high top seating for those who want more of a \"bar\" experience.\n\nWe ordered a variety of foods. The best part about izakayas is that their tapas style allows you to have a lot of different foods even when it's just a few people. Here are my thoughts on some of the foods I ordered:\n\nUnagi Risotto - normally, I don't usually eat unagi (even in sushi)... but somehow the taste of the japanese unagi combined with the risotto rice and cheese, is an amazing flavour. the risotto is cooked well - the rice isn't too tough, but it's not too soft to the point where it's just mush. The hint of cheese flavour nicely complements the rice and the unagi... and gives it a nice twist to how we usually eat risotto. Def. recommend trying this one.\n\nMonkfish tacos - I love fish tacos... so needless to say when I saw that on the menu I had to try it. I was not disappointed. The pairing of the sides along with the freshly deep fried monkfish makes it an amazing fish taco (and I've had my fair shares of fish tacos). The monkfish texture is great, the flavour is fresh and the fish has a bit of spring to it. If you aren't a fish person.. you can try their bulgogi tacos (beef)...  the bulgogi beef is a refreshing change from your typical ground beef tacos. Both options are great so I would say try the fish or the beef depending on your preferences.\n\nJapaburger - Now, i didn't order it this time, but I've had it a few times in the past. If you love sliders... and cheese on burgers... this is for you. The portions are small, so you don't feel disgustingly full after eating the burger, it's a perfect size to taste the burger, and the burger flavour is nicely complemented by the toppings that go along with it. The beef patty is fresh and well cooked. This will definitely be a favourite for those who love burgers/sliders... almost every table usually orders one of these.\n\nTuna coin - Now onto their specialty rolls... but this is hands down my favourite. little dish of seaweed wrapped rice lightly fried topped with cucumber and a chunk of spicy raw tuna and a little tomato on top. Perfectly eaten in one bite, and the combination of flavours is fab. Those who love tuna sashimi, esp spicy tuna sushi/maki... this is an amazing twist to the usual and this little bites go quick after making around the table!\n\nTiger Shrimp - I have to say, this is probably my highlight of the evening. 6 nice sized pieces of deep fried battered tiger shrimp with a sweet and tangy sauce, accompanied by the fried shrimp chips. the flavour of the sauce is AMAZING... I can still imagine how it taste in my mouth as I'm writing this review lol. The batter is light, and not too heavy, so you don't feel gross after eating something deep fried. But yes, definitely order this if you like shrimp. I can easily eat one order of this just on my own :)\n\nSalmon Kimchi Poke - this is one of their newer feature items, so i decided to give it a try. I was a bit disappointed. the flavours were there, your typical poke... but the pieces were so small, and it wasn't served with any chips or crackers on the side, it makes it very hard to eat actually. Also there was much more fillers than the salmon itself, so I wasn't very impressed with this dish.\n\nBBQ duck roll - I decided to try one of their other ones after having the tuna coin... not huge fan.  most times I'm usually pretty good with eating duck... but for some reason this BBQ duck roll, the duck didn't have much seasoning on it, and taste kinda gamey. There is the sauce on top of the roll which helps flavour the duck, but in general I didn't really like it... judging by the fact that there were still 3 pieces left on the plate, it's clear that it wasn't a favourite at our table.\n\ndeep fried pork belly - another one of my favourites. I like that the deep frying actually changes the texture of the pork belly... most of us are used to pork belly being soft and melting in your mouth. The batter gave it a bit of crunch and the pork belly inside actually had more texture than i expected. It comes with a drizzle of sauce on top (assuming i'ts hoisin)... and it's quite nice - we really enjoyed it :)\n\nShort ribs - now they advertise this on their menu as the best in the city. I don't know if it's best in the city, but it's certainly one of the better ones I've had :) I really enjoyed their short ribs, the meat is packed with flavour, it's cooked medium so the short ribs are juicy and tender. Those who love beef and short ribs, definitely get an order of this.\n\nLast but not least... get their sweet bread!! honey bread brick with ice-cream... perfect for sharing this dessert at the end of an epic delicious meal :)\nAND... $1 oysters Tues & Wed nights!", "business_id": "SjgeuBlgKER9yegpoxT99w", "stars": 5, "date": "2017-11-07", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "YMTcBb6Vj54rd_NuFtb8QQ", "review_id": "9ZgWH-15fxgiVCtLHyXocQ", "text": "I've been here a few times over the last two years and their food is always really great.

We also ordered a pitcher of tropical sangria to share. it was really good :)\n\nwe ordered the smoked eggplant on a slice of toast - it was alright, I could taste the smoke but otherwise it wasn't very spectacular.\n\nSpanish meatballs: must have and must try. the tomato sauce it comes in is delicious and the meat is quite tender!\n\nFried Pork belly: another must have - the skin was nice and crispy, and the meat is balanced out with the pork fat so it's not overly mushy and not overly dry.\n\nMushroom Croquette: it was DEF. a must eat!!!! this was actually my favourite tapa along with the meatballs. it's basically mushroom with a deep fried dough with something creamy inside. arg enjoyed every bite!\n\nCarne Paella: we decided not to try the tapagria one only because my friend doen'st like octopus. This paella was very good! the portions are enough for 4 ppl to split equally no problem. the taste was well balanced witht he meat, not overly salty and we all had second scoops :)\n\nDessert we had the spanish toast - since ppl raved about it on yelp and also as per our waitress' recommendfation. it's basically a very RICH pancake soaked in custard sauce with caramel drizzled over. since we already ate so much food, a quarter of the toast per person was the perfect amt for tasting and not feel grossly full lol.\n\nAll in all, i enjoyed this place! and would def. consider coming back again in the future :)", "business_id": "IRzY7yoBqoHaZNNo8WiWQQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2016-07-26", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "YMTcBb6Vj54rd_NuFtb8QQ", "review_id": "lrCr75posiyiVMwO5bqDpA", "text": "love this little gem!!\nthe first time I came here, everything was almost sold out :( I ended up getting a lemon tart and one of their savory croissants.\n\nlemon tart: delish, i loved the strong lemon flavour but yet it wasn't overly tart.

Their lava cake was kind of disappointment as it was slightly over cooked and did not melt out the way it should. For those who like creams br\u00fbl\u00e9e please don't order it. The custard was bland, they didn't even use vanilla bean in the original flavour and their layer of caramelized sugar is super thin, basically didn't even crack when I hit it with the spoon coz it just gave away. Custard was also not the right texture. Overall the gelato fondue is great but their other desserts so far is okay. (Macarons are alright). Also servers aren't very good at English just FYI, the ones serving us tonight didn't even understand what lactose free milk was and was very impatient when we were asking questions about their menu.

It's not cheap though, but usually I get their noodle bowls. A few apps I do like: popcorn chicken. Must get. Seriously. It's addictive and delicious, albeit on the oily side.
