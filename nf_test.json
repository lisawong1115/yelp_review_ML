He answered several questions I had before I could even ask, and his answers definitely put me at ease. We had to call the on call service when I spoke with Dr Curran, and he gave us great advice and then also saw us the next day in the office. And he was just as great as Dr Aaron. I've also spoken with the nurse during office hours on the phone, and she's always been very thorough and understanding. Overall, as a first time parent I feel I may be too sensitive to things but the doctors and the office staff don't make me feel that way at all.

I tired a cup of their pozole soup and it was fine, but I've had better. For my entree I ordered the salmon which came with a pomegranate BBQ glaze, mashed potatoes, and brussel sprouts. This entree was AMAZING! I loved everything about this dish. The salmon was perfectly cooked, the mashed potatoes were velvety and smooth, and the brussels had a slight crunch. I was going to to return for this exact dish, but It seems that this entree is not on their regular menu so I am super bummed out about that. For my dessert, I had the Chocolate Ancho Pecan Pie and this was tasty too. I want to return and try their Texas Torpedos. A couple next to me ordered those and they looked delicious.

It is also only my second time eating Indian food. I may not know anything about authentic Indian food, but I do know when food tastes good.  I've never eaten at the actual restaurant, so my review is based solely on the food. The two times I've ordered take-out from here I have gotten the Butter Chicken, medium spice, and the Keema Naan. The keema naan is just naan \"bread\" stuffed with lamb meat. The medium spice on the butter chicken is spicier than \"medium.\" However, I really enjoy it! The white rice that the dish comes with helps tame the spiciness. I do find myself taking some breaks in between bites. If you aren't someone that regularly eats spicy food I would recommend mild spice. This dish also contains peanuts, so beware to those that can't consume nuts! I enjoy ordering the naan with this entree because it works like a sponge to soak up all the sauce from the butter chicken and it is like a palate cleanser. Tonight was just one of those nights that I was craving some flavorful, filling take out. I received my order promptly and it satisfied my craving to a T. I'm a happy gal!

The dill sauce dip was flavorful and had a good bite to it. As an entree I had the Graze Burger, and although the meat was juicy and tender, the burger itself was a little boring. It really was a burger topped with some caramelized onions. Nothing too special.  I also tried the cream soda. I sort of had the perception that it would be the retro rad cream soda that I remember drinking when I was a kid, but instead it seemed like soda mixed in with vanilla ice cream.

Carpet was only in two bedrooms, one large, one small.   In the mail, we found a coupon for carpet cleaning from Green Carpet Cleaning for four rooms for $59.00.  We set up an appointment for a technician to clean the two rooms.   As soon as he got there, he started to upsell.   His first price to \"really\" clean this carpet was a whopping $179.00!  My husband said NO.   He then called his \"boss\" who said he could do it for $159.00.   Again, my husband said no, this was just a rental and we were not going to pay that kind of price for carpet cleaning.  I was not there at the time, but it I had been, I would have told him to leave and gotten someone else.   My husband made him stick to the $59.00 price.   What you get for $59.00 for two rooms from this company is steam cleaning and nothing else.  He would not use shampoo or any of the \"eco\" products they advertise.  Just plain water steam.   When he was finished, there were still indents in the carpet from the beds that had been there.   He was asked to rake the carpet up and the technician told him that would be an additional charge.

Needed a break from the usual Biltmore corridor fare. Someone threw out the idea of bbq and this was closest. \n\nLarge place, lots of seating at booths or tables (seat yourself) clean, dark and casual. Sparsely decorated with no real theme or atmosphere and a couple of TVs playing quietly. You order at the counter and they bring it to your table. Meats come un-sauced and they have three or four different sauces at a central counter you help yourself to. Crowd was sparse and a mix of suits and uniforms  service was friendly and competent and they explained how to order since it was our first time. \n\nMy lunch mate had the pulled pork sandwich which is simply meat in a bun and a side of green chili Mac and cheese. \n\nI had a two meat combo with brisket and tri-tip and the Mac on the side and ordered a slice of the gooey butter cake for us to share. Combo comes with Texas toast. \n\nPulled pork was excellent, smoky and well cooked. The brisket and tri-tip were ok, not horrible, not memorable and all my food, including the toast, was room temperature and dry. Mac and cheese are individual (not suitable for sharing as an FYI) a la carte portions and was tasty and heated through. Drinks are also self service and the ice tea was fresh and it appears they have beer, wine and cocktails. My lunchmate noted that the choices are \"white\" and \"red\" and are $9 a glass, cocktails are $7 and beers are $5, going on memory. \n\nCombined this very simple meal was about $35.00+ and frankly for that much was not comparable to what you'd get for the same money at many other places in the area, for instance at OSHO a short distance away that serves really great hit and juicy pulled pork, brisket and pastrami sandwiches with good sides in a slightly nicer environment, or for that matter Hillstones at the Biltmore, where we could have eaten for a comparable cost.", "business_id": "N3GQ4GhQviglogQR1dPNgg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-10-16", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "tWJrrj2WUCCU5l6DwvRnOQ", "review_id": "rvX9ujCzL0ZTrfTfz_WNRA", "text": "Great food in a small, loud restaurant and bar populated by neighborhood cougars and the men that love them, at least while they are there.

If you expect an email back ten minutes after you send it, then that's your problem. And if you expect an appointment within a week, then that's also your misguided judgement.

We got Italian sodas and  the price is what we would have spent at Chipotle, so it is very affordable   The sauce was not as temperature hot as I would have liked, so the dish was cold in spots, but hey, it's pasta,s so it can be eaten cold, which I do frequently, so I was not upset.  The best part was the garlic piada that comes with the pasta or the salad.  It reminded me of Naan, which I LOVE and I love garlic naan, so already liking it.  IT'S FULL OF CHEESE!    I am an unabashed cheese freak (you can never have too much cheese or chocolate).  The artichokes were cleaned, grilled with nice crispy char, and (cue the fan fare) acidulated ( you need to put fresh ones in water with lemon juice or they turn brown. Like avocado's for guac.)

Noodles were way over cooked, soup doesn't have much lemon grass flavor and it has too much meat going on in there from tendons to pigs skins to pieces of slices of beef shanks and meat patties like. The pork blood wasn't fresh - has a stinky smell to it and there weren't enough Vietnamese herbs and vegetables that should come with this noodle dish on the side.

The reviews were very good, the restaurant was close and there was a good time available. As I was alone, I was given a small table close to the kitchen, which was understandable. However, I didn't really enjoy the constant parade of waiters brushing my shoulder every time they went by. Service from my waiter was a bit slow and he was indifferent. Whenever I try a new steakhouse, I normally order my favorite, tenderloin Oscar Style. To me this is a perfect way to see if a steakhouse is worth its' salt. With a name like Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab expectations were understandably high. I ordered it medium rare. When it came, it came with crab on top and sauce on the side, it looked like a beautiful piece of meat but was disappointed when I cut into the middle of it and it was RAW, as in the top 1/4\" and bottom 1/4\" were cooked properly but the middle 1\" looked blue. When I told my waiter that it was RAW in the middle, he started an argument with me by asking me \"I thought you ordered it medium rare?\", I said \"I did, but this is RAW in the middle.\" \"So you don't want it medium rare?\" I said, \"That isn't medium rare.\" \"You sure?\" as he made a big show of bending down and examining the steak and then giving a patronizing look. \"So you would like your steak cooked medium, then?\" I said \"Medium rare\" He eventually took my plate back to the kitchen and 20 min later came out with it again. The steak was now overcooked, the sides were cold, which means they didn't keep my plate warm, the crab was now off to the side and not on top and the b\u00e9arnaise sauce was cold. I know I was a single table but I didn't deserve to be treated like crap. I'm sure most people get treated better than I but I cannot recommend this place to anybody.

Both times have been alright, but absolutely nothing to write home about.\n\n\n The first time, with my friend, I had the chicken burrito while she had the chicken quesadilla. She enjoyed her quesadilla, but admitted she didn't know how authentic it was as she hadn't tried one before. My burrito was alright. I had the pinto beans the hot salsa and paid the extra for guacamole, sour cream and jalapenos. Despite this, I found it to be very dry, there was no taste on the chicken from the marinade, the hot salsa had no heat and the jalapenos were underwhelming to say the least.\n\n\n I went back a second time, a few weeks later, to give the place a second chance. I ordered the same thing again in case I had just been in at a bad time before, but unfortunately it was even drier this time due to the fact that I didn't get the sour cream I'd asked, and been charged, for. I didn't realise this until later on, so it wasn't brought up with the staff at the time.\n\n\n Now don't get me wrong, there is nothing bad about the food there at all. It's just underwhelming. To me, the marinade does nothing to the chicken, the salsa and jalapenos are both marked as hot when they are nothing of the kind and there is no where near enough moisture in the burrito.\n\n\n I fully accept that this is down to my own personal tastes, but if I am to go back, it will purely be for convenience and nothing else.\n\n\n There's far too much hype put out about this place and you really shouldn't believe it all.", "business_id": "L3GSBM-3cUGiEWqcnNF9lA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-07-30", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "Q58U8-HyTDAYEGY13DLEUw", "review_id": "wiyqawSJHQO_q3js5EfQOQ", "text": "Lovely wee pub at Haymarket, that always seems busy.\n\n\n There is a basement bar as well, that features comedy every Thursday as well as other regular nights.\n\n\n Only eaten in here a couple of times, but the tempura prawns are lovely!!", "business_id": "eeN4omwZZc8C3O-XAxZ-HQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-01-06", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "Q58U8-HyTDAYEGY13DLEUw", "review_id": "BN9Sd0COGv4Kmpyo0I1wdQ", "text": "I've been to Zucca twice now.

You do have the option on most to choose baked or fried.\nYou can also get dip with it, they have two options for dip. My personal fav is the spinach one which is more orange in color, it has a bit of spice/kick to it.\nThey aren't as filling as i would have hoped , so you end up having to buy a few to feel satisfied.

Which was a bit awkward. They forgot my side order of baked beans, which was a bit annoying. I ordered the CHILAQUILES RANCHEROS, which was just ok to be honest. The poached eggs were done perfectly, the tortilla and veggies were really soggy , lastly the home fries were ok. I also got a few chips w them which were nice for dipping \n\nMy partner got chicken and waffles. He felt the waffles weren't crispy enough and the jalape\u00f1o flavour was a bit too much . After we received our food we still had to flag down the waiter for cutlery and syrup. \n\nExperience and food was ok but definitely not worth the wait..prices are fair but based on everything as a whole won't be returning .", "business_id": "bu_vAwJG1DHhM5f6ePjXog", "stars": 3, "date": "2017-03-19", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "XYl43Jgcl_AgM5YXDFVy5A", "review_id": "7pm9QfyUbYnwJPIDn2KoSw", "text": "I loved this place\nCustomer service is stellar\nThe pies are to die for ..super tasty\nnice flaky pie crust consistency and flavorful on the inside\nServing size is amazing i went in for lunch and couldn't finish my pie had the rest as a snack after work\nWill definitely be back", "business_id": "ofw8aDSEg1HoQdmCgvLtaQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2016-10-24", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "XYl43Jgcl_AgM5YXDFVy5A", "review_id": "fce90Yu0xH38QbGuUXU9Fg", "text": "Let me start by saying WOW, not sure why they have low reviews but also humans tend to complain about the smallest things and we love to place blame.\nThis was my first time here, I usually go to the Scarborough location (amazing food), been to the Creditview location once (thumbs down).

I mean there was even fruit flies , such a turn off.\nFinally we find our theater and the previews are nearly the end but the place is full of kids or teens whatever they are still talking and using their phones.

The soup dumplings (Xiao long bao) were juicy, the cold pork cut with garlic (Suan ni bai rou) hit the spot perfectly.

The pizzas themselves were alright - I enjoyed the crust, but the flavour combinations sounded better on paper than in reality. We ordered the BC, the special (some meaty boar pizza) and the Shinny, a mushroomy pizza. The sauce tasted homogenously tomatoey, with varying levels of spiciness.

The prices are good for what it is, and coming from a place where sushi is $$$, this is always a treat. And the selection is awesome - perhaps not necessarily the types of rolls (average, I'd say), but lots of non-sushi items that are excellent.\n\nI'd have to agree with the previous reviewers that the service is not stellar; like most Chinese-run sushi restaurants, it takes some effort to flag down someone for more tea or your bill. It's definitely an efficient no-nonsense type environment, where the servers are curt in taking your order or bringing you food, without spending too much time pampering and sweet talking for a bigger tip. Personally, I don't mind this (I'm here to fill my belly with sushi, not get asked 100 times how the food is), but I suppose some people might find this poor service. \n\nDon't expect to get your palate tickled by high-end Japanese delicacies.

Its the only one i've ever been to and im soo glad that it is literally just seconds from my home. I've been coming to this fish and chips store ever since i was a kid and was attending  the elementary school down the street. I gotta say the prices did go up... i remember buying just the chips for $2.10 and now its about $3.25. I remember asking the lady there why did you guys increase the price (just out of curiosity) and she claimed that they haven't and it was always at that price which is completely wrong lool. \n\nBut nevertheless i really love this fish and chips store....i usually just get the chips but whenever i buy both, the fish comes out really greasy and if you squeeze it a bit, it does drip out of your hands so if you have high cholesterol or not into oily fish then stay away!\n\n But in my case the fries i gotta say is AMAZING its actually the best tasting fries i have ever  tasted (and i've tasted many different fries but this beats them all!!). They have other things on the menu like onion rings and other types of fish and beef-gravy (no chicken) but i have never had any other things in the menu besides there specialty. \n\nThere is no seats inside to sit and eat, just a little waiting area around the corner to wait for your order but they do have a little bench outside that people tend to sit and enjoy there fish and chips. The store itself isn't appealing...dark and full of potted plants on the window and not bright. \n\nBut overall i only go for the food..don't really care much about the store design. The price of the chips if ya'll are wondering is $3.25 for the chips and $9.90 for the fish and chips. \n\nOh, most importantly this is CASH ONLY they don't accept visa/debit and they do have a beverage fridge in the corner.", "business_id": "GtO_zfsrgShKG7KW6zahSg", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-07-23", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "Fe-oeVVYbPvQkZ3fLAlyig", "review_id": "DKy7i4ZL6glIUHUslnYCAg", "text": "After a long day shopping of course we got hungry so we went to Pickle Barrel to eat.

My credit was not strong enough to purchase a vehicle on my own even though I make a great deal of money per year from my government job.  Okay, Sure understandable.  One of the managers scolded me for helping in signing for too many OTHER cars...then he aggressively insisted that others help me sign into a vehicle in the same manner in which I helped them sign into theirs.  I left the establishment browsing vehicles as I left knowing I would eventually be back because I like Hyundai engineering and the location was convenient to the freeway.  My departure browsing was mostly for show because they made me feel humiliated and I'm a hard working gentleman...so I didn't want to give them the satisfaction of leaving \"tuck tail\" beaten dog like.  The original salesman met me outside as I was leaving the establishment and encouraged me if I could convince my mother to return with me she could sign with me and I could get a car.  I went home and talked it over with my mom.  While home, ABC Hyundai called and assured us we would leave with a car if only I could get my mother APPLY ONLINE then return with me as a co signer.  I explained to them I could have money down but not until a few days later after I get paid.  It was 730pm and my 59 year old mom worked at 5am the next day.  She agreed to help me because she has a kind and caring heart.  We returned to ABC Hyundai and they started the credit process AGAIN because for \"Some reason\" they couldn't locate her online application that SHE JUST SENT ONLINE BEFORE LEAVING THE HOUSE.  So after another 9 minutes AFTER ARRIVING and recollecting my mothers info into their tablet...all of the workers huddled back in their offices with my mothers NEWLY ACQUIRED information  EVEN THOUGH SHE ALREADY SENT IN AN ONLINE APPLICATION.  They eventually came out...offering a \"Gift\" that would only be approved in my mothers name because my own credit history was too negative.  The \"gift\" offered was a single choice of vehicle...their smallest, and the oldest vehicle that had been test driven for over 1 year.  The 2018's are on the lot...and they only offered her a 2017 with over 60 miles on the odometer (the test drive was only 4 miles).  Okay, sure understandable.  Fair, enough.  Whatever...that's all I could say.  Perhaps they could have mentioned that all to us.  I brought my mother back into their lot....the fact that my name wouldn't be on the registration and all the pressure would alllll be on just my mom alone was kept secret.  They already ran my credit beforehand.  They had my mothers credit from the ABC Hyundai website WHICH SHE SENT IN 45 minutes prior...they could have had things figured out BEFORE we arrived since my down payment was already written on paper as to what date I could provide it.  So after explaining the \"Gift\" on how they're going to clear their inventory and shift us a year old dinosaur....they asked...yes, wait for it.....HOW I WOULD BE PUTTING THE MONEY DOWN!!!???  Facepalm...\"You guys don't remember telling you clearly that I have no money down today???\"  Seems they selectively forgot that fact.\n\nSo we sign and we're out of there by 1030pm.  My poor mother needs rest but is excited to help introduce a vehicle into the family (Even though I will be making the payments myself, we call it HER car :)  ).  So the next day she must return to deliver the cash which they THOUGHT I was going to deliver the 1st night, even though I clearly stated....NO MONEY TONIGHT AT ALL...LATER MONEY YES....NONE TONIGHT...LATER YES...NONE TONIGHT....\nWe sign a few more papers which were over looked the 1st day.  Okay, great now everything is in order.  Right???\n\nTurns out they forgot ANOTHER item and now me and my mom had to return a THIRD time.  One of the dates on the original contract was not updated the 2nd time around and either we come back a 3rd time to sign, or we would be lacking a particular vital insurance coverage.  So, yes of course we returned for a 3rd visit.  \n\nIt feels strange to sign a contract that says, \"once you leave the lot you are the owner of the vehicle in which there's no backing out\"....but then to be slammed with several messages for days afterwards which state...return to the lot or else the original deal will be modified.\n\nSo the experience was completed, yes.  Yes, we did get the car.  Yes, they did work with us eventually.  But it felt as though a court trial, circus, and comedy ROAST were were all combined into one package.  No not very pleasant.  I told them I will need another car in 30 days...but I'now I'm hesitant.  Do I really want to submit myself to that treatment again??  I'm happy to have a vehicle which I can pay for...but must I be humiliated and made to come back time and time again?  Nobody even offered Coffee or Cocoa like they did on the 1st night!  :(\nCoffee/Cocoa must be hot brewed and takes time....they will only volunteer water unless you ask otherwise...", "business_id": "G6GWOAPmCGSiMleJUzta8A", "stars": 2, "date": "2017-12-10", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "Pni3Z-FG6frCZLJBdFyMhw", "review_id": "Y56kh26ZAl4bD8pVq-tZGw", "text": "Visited twice to the India Palace restaurant on my trip to Las vegas.

In  speaking to others they have also shared their experiences with poor customer service at this location.  I live in Goodyear so it's unfortunate. I had a waitress who first thought it excusable to not wait my table for more than 20 minutes after being seated, then she tried lie by saying she wasn't our waitress, to make maters worse she claimed my husband was cursing at her(which he never even gave a tone like he was using foul language) and the worst part is she continued to harass us by returning to our table after I had requested the manager. I finally decided to walk to the counter to ask for the manager myself she followed me continuing to harass me. The manager wasn't much better.

He was checking with the host to see if maybe tables were switched on her or something that could have thrown her off. I don't think that should matter, regardless of the reason, there should be no excuse for that type of behavior. He did apologized and asked if there was anything he could do for us. I was not looking for handouts,  but in my past experience with poor service, the management has never asked me if there is anything they could do for me. Instead they took the initiative to try and make things right. Then I received an email response which stated \"We strive very hard to make orders correct the first time, but we are only human and we sometimes make mistakes.\" This was spilled water, that would be a mistake.

My first visit, it was all I could do to get in the office I was in such bad shape. I had many injuries over the years and never really healed from them properly. I was in constant pain. I hobbled around like I was 150 years old. I did not want to rely on prescription meds to ease my pain. So I went to Community Chiropractic. I left that first day feeling better than I had felt in years. But due to my many years of neglecting my body, I needed much more attention than you can get in one visit. Dr Eaton worked with me and helped me understand what I needed to do to get  the best response from my body. He also showed me ways to make my body stronger in my problem/injured areas so I could be in less pain. Getting stronger has enabled me to a better quality of life with a lot less pain and aggravation. I once thought I was doomed to a life of pain. So glad things have turned around for me. I credit much of that to Dr Eaton. My visits now are much less frequent then they once were also. Just another sign that what Dr Eaton does WORKS!\nFrom the moment you walk into the office, you know you're in a place that truly cares. Maryanne always greets you with a cheery welcome and makes you feel like you're with people that care about you. Because they do! Usually not much of a wait before Dr Eaton has you in a treatment room.  Once inside his hands on approach will have you feeling better in no time. He is always kind and caring. Very thorough and..... he's the best! It is really the only way I can describe my visits. Maryanne and Spencer are wonderful people! I can't say enough!  Another thing I really like/love about them.... even though we're all here in the big city, they give you that small town community feel. Community Chiropractic is the BEST!

After the wine arrived we were left unattended for a long while to the point that I had to ask for the check three times to two different people.

We were introduced to Tom, the owner,  who offered his expertise.  Everyone at Lynne's were very upbeat and professional including the gal at the front desk and the warehouse guys who packed the  furniture in our trailer...it took 3 trips to get everything home...We enjoyed our shopping experience and will definitely return.", "business_id": "e-NX-4YEUrxvn_vd6pqUaA", "stars": 5, "date": "2017-05-04", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "us-v0xh7xVNi-12T6KyPDg", "review_id": "HAdAE5WmPj_I3Vzhmh_3HQ", "text": "Been seeing Dr A rn for almost 25 years and wouldn't trust my pointers health well being to any other vet.

I woke up on Friday morning before an extended weekend with intense tooth pain. My former dentist of five years was closed for the holiday and unable to see me until the following Wednesday. That's no good, my tooth hurts and I'm apparently whining like a small child. My girlfriend called and scheduled me an appointment (way to reward my bad behavior) with Dr Chiem, and they were able to squeeze me in later that same day. \n\nTurns out my old dentist hadn't done the best job installing a cavity. A portion of the cavity had fallen out (hence the pain). The cavity had failed and my tooth has been rotting and I now required a root canal. I was given an estimate (which was very fair) with the opportunity to have to work done right then and there. There's not much I can say, it went as well as a root canal can go. I was given plenty of numbing medication and the doctor checked my comfort levels throughout the procedure (I didn't feel a thing. About an hour later and I was done. I was fitted for a crown and a followup appointment was scheduled for the following week. I left with two prescriptions and less roots. \n\nMy mouth was slightly sore the next morning from being stuck open for so long, and the surrounding gums were also a little sensitive (I was warned this would be the case). I took my pain meds and antibiotics as prescribed and everything felt fine the next morning. I had one more follow up appointment, at no charge, before scheduling my crown install. My tooth was inspected to insure the doctor was comfortable with the results before installing my crown. I couldn't feel anything around the tooth (that's good, that's the whole point of the procedure). I was told to finish up my antibiotics and we scheduled my install appointment for my crown. I'll update my review when they're done with the crown, unless I forget, in which case I'm either dead and unable to update or forgot to update. Either way, I wouldn't fault Stars Dental, unless they somehow killed me by installing a crown. I'm going to assume my gf would update my review or leave her own review discussing how they killed me and I'm now haunting the office.

I went in to get my order at this tiny window that has no line of sight so you're left waiting awkwardly because you can't see them and they can't see you. Then I'm told with my order one item was not available. I simply asked them to take it off the order and was told \"no I can't\". I'm sorry what? So I'm not getting the product I ordered, yes you offered something else that was not wanted, but refuse to take the expense off if the offered replacement is not taken? This makes zero sense to me.

The flavours were there... but was nothing spectacular, and I wish there was a little more than 3 pieces.

It tasted quite dry and resembled a chicken nugget more than anything.\n\nFor my main course I ordered the Veal Osso Buco with tomato sauce and red wine. I found it quite tough and dry, and the sauce did not have any red wine taste to it. It was pretty disappointing. I had a few bites of my friend's lamb shank (in the same sauce) and although it was more tender than my veal, I still felt it was missing that \"off the bone\" tenderness and yummy lamb taste. \n\nLastly, I had the warm white chocolate lava cake. This was quite good; the white chocolate centre and vanilla ice cream really balanced out the sweetness of the chocolate cake. It was also very wam and soft, but it seemed like it was heated last minute in the microwave. It was still a nice finish to the meal.\n\nOverall, the food was quite mediocre and since the tables were all very close to one another, I felt very cramped during my dining experience.

The cookies and cream chocolate dip was soooooooooooo thick I feel like I've never had an ice cream cone dip like that before!

The chocolate dip was also exactly like a cookies and cream bar; it felt like I was eating ice cream and a whole bar at the same time.

Plus, the strawberry ice cream (which paired really well with the cookies and cream) helped even out the sweetness.\n\nOverall, the \"mini\" size was more than enough for me, making the price quite worth it.\n\nThey also have a vast array of chocolates (including Belgian chocolates and some matcha flavoured ones), as well as gelato and milkshakes--I'm pretty excited to try those out soon!\n\nIt's been a few days since I visited, and I'm still telling my friends and family how awesome the cone dips were!

(That meal I would give a 2/5). \n\nThis time, from the recommendation of my sister, I got the Miso Ramen. This was the complete opposite of the shoyu soup I had because I found this soup to be too bland. It just didn't wow me! And although I could have finished the bowl at the end of the meal, I chose not to because I didn't find the soup that great. It was, however, an improvement from the Shoyu Ramen. \n\nThe thick noodles were quite good, but the toppings that come with all the ramen were lacking. I did find their pork to be very tender and juicy though. \n\nMy friends ordered the original Ramen which comes with an egg (whereas the miso did not) and they both said they enjoyed their ramen and soup. \n\nOverall, kinton feels very average to me, and since it's in proximity to where I usually \"chill\", I most likely will come back....if I'm desperate. \n\nPerhaps next time I'll try the spicy garlic ramen--I'm sure that one might be more flavourful. But for now, I have yet to find something \"special\" about kinton.", "business_id": "piZ4JqJI5WTljJuQV7yZHQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2017-01-28", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "P-HfoWZ4nrgqhqEbbhWuUw", "review_id": "s7NWvNoAl0YCaCvZYVoahw", "text": "I just recently came in contact with Angela through Mountain Pacific Insurance.

A Mexican lady attempted to cook my husband and I Mediterranean food. Our kabob plate was a flattened, grilled chicken breast. It was seasoned with chili powder and served with a green salsa (delicious, but not Mediterranean). She had to look at the photos on the menu in order to make the plates. She did not speak English. When she brought out the hummus (that appeared to be aged based on darkened color and thickness), she did not understand that pita was supposed to come with it. Finally, by using the Spanish word for bread, she brought us a plate with a thick piece of dense, stale bread. We tried the food, just for the heck of it, and the woman actually did a spectacular job on the chicken and salsa. But what we were served, was not Mediterranean. That lady could not possibly work there. She had zero clue how or what to cook. On top of our chicken 'kabob' plate and hummus, we also got a chicken pita gyro.... and because she looked at the photo, it was ACTUALLY ON A PITA! The pita however, was older than I could probably count on all of my fingers and toes, and harder than a rock. So, we passed on it. We finally got to the paying part of the visit and when I thought the experience couldn't get any weirder.. it did. The Mexican lady came around the counter and looked up at the photo menu with prices, counted, added, and gave us a price of $26 in Spanish. My husband gave her the correct price, $29 and then told her that we had a restaurant.com coupon for $15. He relayed it to her a second time in Spanish, and when she 'understood', she said that we could only pay her in cash. So we gave her the difference and a tip (because even though she obviously didn't actually work there or have any idea what she was doing in terms of Mediterranean, she cooked a phenomenal chicken and made authentic salsa). The lady didn't even ring in the order, so she obviously couldn't log in to the iPad. I have no idea what she was doing in this hole in the wall, run down business, but she didn't belong. The restaurant looked like it shouldn't be in business any longer.

We spoke with one of the staff, who gave us pretty good recommendations on a few dishes that we could try, and I must admit, all the dishes were cooked very nicely, great taste, though they are on the pricier side, I feel that  you get what you pay for (if you want better quality food, it comes at a price). \n\nSoya sauce chicken is AMAZING. The chicken was super smooth, moist, and the soy taste was not overpowering the chicken. \nWe ordered this dish that had a variety of greens, including zucchini, lotus, celery, parsnip(?) stir-fried. it was delicious! the ingredients are fresh, and it wasn't too oily for a stir-fry.\nFor those who love seafood, their honey fried oysters are wonderful! The texture was nice and crisp, full of the honey flavour, and the oysters were HUGE! Definitely a delight to eat :)\n\nNext time I would like to try their lobster and their peking duck (they do have some dinner specials)!", "business_id": "dKOrxsz6ygqa-AatwzpKyQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2016-01-08", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "YMTcBb6Vj54rd_NuFtb8QQ", "review_id": "Vs4ec8QQdXVnzgFbApQo0Q", "text": "I came here on my way to visit my friend's new baby on a Saturday morning. this little cafe totally reminds me of the local coffee shops i used to frequent in downtown Toronto back in the days before I moved out to the suburbs... i love this little gem!! It's not a very big space, but it's cosy, with some tables and chairs for small groups to meet. \n\nThey do have a vareity of options for breakfast and lunch. The espresso and coffee menu is also quite diverse. I ordered a caffe latte and a scone and muffin. the green tea white chocolate scone was delish! it had hints of those flavours and the scone was soft and fluffy. the bluberry bran muffin was also another great item to try on the menu. They have sandwiches, yogurts and cookies available as well.\n\nThe latte was really well done. I enjoyed every sip of that cup! I also like how they do a bit of latte art on their drinks (yes even for take out ones) and i'ts just a nice little touch. They also have a variety of milk options for those who can't drink regular milk (lactose free, almond, coconut,soy) - their prices are also quite reasonable and not super expensive. I bought their espresso coffee home - 1 bag is 15 dollars, again cost is quite reasonable and they do roast their own coffee (another perk coz i love buying local coffees to use at home).\n\nThis place is not too far from home, so def. expect me to be back on a regular basis!", "business_id": "sd4BuC4Om6WuvnP87ZS8Og", "stars": 5, "date": "2016-07-26", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "YMTcBb6Vj54rd_NuFtb8QQ", "review_id": "MIJipUuGwSrEw6QyPA9NLQ", "text": "My future MIL - bless her, she actually went and got both the original and the matcha cheesecakes!!

We came in on a Monday night and the place is pretty full for a weekday evening. Ambience is nice, casual, they have both dinner seating as well as high top seating for those who want more of a \"bar\" experience.\n\nWe ordered a variety of foods. The best part about izakayas is that their tapas style allows you to have a lot of different foods even when it's just a few people. Here are my thoughts on some of the foods I ordered:\n\nUnagi Risotto - normally, I don't usually eat unagi (even in sushi)... but somehow the taste of the japanese unagi combined with the risotto rice and cheese, is an amazing flavour. the risotto is cooked well - the rice isn't too tough, but it's not too soft to the point where it's just mush. The hint of cheese flavour nicely complements the rice and the unagi... and gives it a nice twist to how we usually eat risotto. Def. recommend trying this one.\n\nMonkfish tacos - I love fish tacos... so needless to say when I saw that on the menu I had to try it. I was not disappointed. The pairing of the sides along with the freshly deep fried monkfish makes it an amazing fish taco (and I've had my fair shares of fish tacos). The monkfish texture is great, the flavour is fresh and the fish has a bit of spring to it. If you aren't a fish person.. you can try their bulgogi tacos (beef)...  the bulgogi beef is a refreshing change from your typical ground beef tacos. Both options are great so I would say try the fish or the beef depending on your preferences.\n\nJapaburger - Now, i didn't order it this time, but I've had it a few times in the past. If you love sliders... and cheese on burgers... this is for you. The portions are small, so you don't feel disgustingly full after eating the burger, it's a perfect size to taste the burger, and the burger flavour is nicely complemented by the toppings that go along with it. The beef patty is fresh and well cooked. This will definitely be a favourite for those who love burgers/sliders... almost every table usually orders one of these.\n\nTuna coin - Now onto their specialty rolls... but this is hands down my favourite. little dish of seaweed wrapped rice lightly fried topped with cucumber and a chunk of spicy raw tuna and a little tomato on top. Perfectly eaten in one bite, and the combination of flavours is fab. Those who love tuna sashimi, esp spicy tuna sushi/maki... this is an amazing twist to the usual and this little bites go quick after making around the table!\n\nTiger Shrimp - I have to say, this is probably my highlight of the evening. 6 nice sized pieces of deep fried battered tiger shrimp with a sweet and tangy sauce, accompanied by the fried shrimp chips. the flavour of the sauce is AMAZING... I can still imagine how it taste in my mouth as I'm writing this review lol. The batter is light, and not too heavy, so you don't feel gross after eating something deep fried. But yes, definitely order this if you like shrimp. I can easily eat one order of this just on my own :)\n\nSalmon Kimchi Poke - this is one of their newer feature items, so i decided to give it a try. I was a bit disappointed. the flavours were there, your typical poke... but the pieces were so small, and it wasn't served with any chips or crackers on the side, it makes it very hard to eat actually. Also there was much more fillers than the salmon itself, so I wasn't very impressed with this dish.\n\nBBQ duck roll - I decided to try one of their other ones after having the tuna coin... not huge fan.  most times I'm usually pretty good with eating duck... but for some reason this BBQ duck roll, the duck didn't have much seasoning on it, and taste kinda gamey. There is the sauce on top of the roll which helps flavour the duck, but in general I didn't really like it... judging by the fact that there were still 3 pieces left on the plate, it's clear that it wasn't a favourite at our table.\n\ndeep fried pork belly - another one of my favourites. I like that the deep frying actually changes the texture of the pork belly... most of us are used to pork belly being soft and melting in your mouth. The batter gave it a bit of crunch and the pork belly inside actually had more texture than i expected. It comes with a drizzle of sauce on top (assuming i'ts hoisin)... and it's quite nice - we really enjoyed it :)\n\nShort ribs - now they advertise this on their menu as the best in the city. I don't know if it's best in the city, but it's certainly one of the better ones I've had :) I really enjoyed their short ribs, the meat is packed with flavour, it's cooked medium so the short ribs are juicy and tender. Those who love beef and short ribs, definitely get an order of this.\n\nLast but not least... get their sweet bread!! honey bread brick with ice-cream... perfect for sharing this dessert at the end of an epic delicious meal :)\nAND... $1 oysters Tues & Wed nights!", "business_id": "SjgeuBlgKER9yegpoxT99w", "stars": 5, "date": "2017-11-07", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "YMTcBb6Vj54rd_NuFtb8QQ", "review_id": "9ZgWH-15fxgiVCtLHyXocQ", "text": "I've been here a few times over the last two years and their food is always really great.

We also ordered a pitcher of tropical sangria to share. it was really good :)\n\nwe ordered the smoked eggplant on a slice of toast - it was alright, I could taste the smoke but otherwise it wasn't very spectacular.\n\nSpanish meatballs: must have and must try. the tomato sauce it comes in is delicious and the meat is quite tender!\n\nFried Pork belly: another must have - the skin was nice and crispy, and the meat is balanced out with the pork fat so it's not overly mushy and not overly dry.\n\nMushroom Croquette: it was DEF. a must eat!!!! this was actually my favourite tapa along with the meatballs. it's basically mushroom with a deep fried dough with something creamy inside. arg enjoyed every bite!\n\nCarne Paella: we decided not to try the tapagria one only because my friend doen'st like octopus. This paella was very good! the portions are enough for 4 ppl to split equally no problem. the taste was well balanced witht he meat, not overly salty and we all had second scoops :)\n\nDessert we had the spanish toast - since ppl raved about it on yelp and also as per our waitress' recommendfation. it's basically a very RICH pancake soaked in custard sauce with caramel drizzled over. since we already ate so much food, a quarter of the toast per person was the perfect amt for tasting and not feel grossly full lol.\n\nAll in all, i enjoyed this place! and would def. consider coming back again in the future :)", "business_id": "IRzY7yoBqoHaZNNo8WiWQQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2016-07-26", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "YMTcBb6Vj54rd_NuFtb8QQ", "review_id": "lrCr75posiyiVMwO5bqDpA", "text": "love this little gem!!\nthe first time I came here, everything was almost sold out :( I ended up getting a lemon tart and one of their savory croissants.\n\nlemon tart: delish, i loved the strong lemon flavour but yet it wasn't overly tart.

Their lava cake was kind of disappointment as it was slightly over cooked and did not melt out the way it should. For those who like creams br\u00fbl\u00e9e please don't order it. The custard was bland, they didn't even use vanilla bean in the original flavour and their layer of caramelized sugar is super thin, basically didn't even crack when I hit it with the spoon coz it just gave away. Custard was also not the right texture. Overall the gelato fondue is great but their other desserts so far is okay. (Macarons are alright). Also servers aren't very good at English just FYI, the ones serving us tonight didn't even understand what lactose free milk was and was very impatient when we were asking questions about their menu.

It's not cheap though, but usually I get their noodle bowls. A few apps I do like: popcorn chicken. Must get. Seriously. It's addictive and delicious, albeit on the oily side.
